# Proof Editor - Core Features Reset

## The Problem We're Solving

**Users need to construct formal logical arguments visually, not write YAML by hand.**

## Current Reality Check

✅ **What Actually Works:**
- YAML document parsing and validation
- VS Code extension loads
- Domain logic architecture 
- Comprehensive test suite

❌ **What Doesn't Work (The Important Stuff):**
- **Visual proof tree display** - Users can't see their arguments
- **Interactive proof construction** - No visual editing
- **Bootstrap user experience** - No onboarding for new users

## Core Features That Must Work

### **1. Visual Proof Tree Display**
**What**: Users can see their logical arguments as a tree structure
**Why**: This is the entire value proposition - visual reasoning
**Success Criteria**: 
- Open a .proof file → see visual tree
- Add statement → tree updates in real-time
- Navigate complex proofs visually

### **2. Interactive Proof Construction**
**What**: Users can build proofs by clicking/typing, not writing YAML
**Why**: YAML editing is not user-friendly for philosophers
**Success Criteria**:
- Click "Add Statement" → type statement → appears in tree
- Click "Add Argument" → connect statements → see logical flow
- Drag/drop to rearrange structure

### **3. Bootstrap Experience**
**What**: New users can go from empty → first proof in 5 minutes
**Why**: Tool adoption requires immediate value demonstration
**Success Criteria**:
- "Create New Proof" → guided tutorial
- Sample proof (Socrates is mortal) → user can recreate
- Clear next steps for building own proofs

### **4. File Operations**
**What**: Save, load, share proof documents
**Why**: Users need to persist and collaborate on work
**Success Criteria**:
- Save proof → reopens with same visual structure
- Share .proof file → others can open and edit
- Export to PDF/image for presentations

## Non-Core Features (Later)

- Advanced validation rules
- Real-time collaboration
- Mobile apps
- Package ecosystem
- AI assistance

## Development Priority

**Phase 1: Make tree visualization actually work**
- Users can see proof structure visually
- Basic interaction (zoom, pan, select)

**Phase 2: Enable visual proof construction**
- Add statements without writing YAML
- Connect statements to form arguments
- Real-time visual feedback

**Phase 3: Polish user experience**
- Bootstrap tutorial for new users
- Error handling and validation feedback
- File sharing and export

## Success Metric

**A philosophy student with no programming background can create their first logical proof in under 10 minutes using only visual interactions.**

If this isn't true, we don't have a proof editor - we have an expensive YAML validator.
