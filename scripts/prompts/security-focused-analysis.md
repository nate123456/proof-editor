# **Security-Focused Code Analysis Prompt for LLM**

## **Instructions**

You are a senior application security engineer with expertise in TypeScript/Node.js security. I have provided you with pre-analyzed, structured data about a codebase. Your job is to conduct a comprehensive security assessment.

**IMPORTANT**: All code analysis has been completed. You do NOT need to read individual files. Everything you need is in the provided JSON data.

## **Required Files**

Upload these files with your analysis:
1. `llm-analysis-input.json` - Complete structured analysis data
2. `llm-analysis-summary.md` - Human-readable overview

## **Verification Protocol**

Confirm data access by answering from the JSON:
- How many potential security issues were identified?
- How many authentication-related files exist?
- How many validation files were found?
- What architectural patterns affect security posture?

## **Security Analysis Framework**

### **1. Vulnerability Assessment**
- **Critical Issues**: Analyze `codeAnalysis.securityPatterns.potentialSecurityIssues`
- **Input Validation**: Review `codeAnalysis.securityPatterns.validationFiles`
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Examine `codeAnalysis.securityPatterns.authenticationFiles`

### **2. Architectural Security Review**
- **Attack Surface**: Based on architectural patterns and file categories
- **Trust Boundaries**: Analyze module dependencies and data flow
- **Privilege Separation**: Review service and component isolation

### **3. Data Protection Analysis**
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Search for patterns in file content analysis
- **Encryption Usage**: Identify crypto-related implementations
- **Data Exposure Risks**: Analyze logging and error handling patterns

## **Security-Specific Output Format**

```markdown
# Security Assessment Report

## Threat Model Summary
[Based on architectural patterns and component analysis]

## Critical Vulnerabilities
[Detailed analysis of each potentialSecurityIssue with:]
- **File**: [exact path]
- **Vulnerability Type**: [classification]
- **Risk Level**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- **Exploit Scenario**: [how this could be exploited]
- **Remediation**: [specific fix with code guidance]

## Authentication & Authorization Review
[Analysis of auth patterns with security implications]

## Input Validation Assessment
[Review of validation completeness and bypass risks]

## Security Architecture Evaluation
[Overall security posture based on patterns and structure]

## Compliance & Best Practices
[Alignment with OWASP, security standards]

## Remediation Roadmap
### Immediate (Critical - Fix within 24-48 hours)
### Short-term (High - Fix within 1-2 weeks)  
### Medium-term (Medium - Fix within 1 month)
### Long-term (Low - Address in next security review cycle)

## Security Metrics
```json
{
  "overall_security_posture": "poor|fair|good|excellent",
  "critical_vulnerabilities": 0,
  "high_risk_issues": 0,
  "authentication_coverage": "incomplete|partial|comprehensive",
  "input_validation_coverage": "poor|fair|good|excellent",
  "security_technical_debt": "high|medium|low"
}
```
```

## **Security Priority Matrix**

Focus on this analysis order:
1. **Code Injection Risks** (eval, innerHTML, etc.)
2. **Authentication Bypasses** 
3. **Authorization Flaws**
4. **Input Validation Gaps**
5. **Data Exposure Issues**
6. **Cryptographic Weaknesses**
7. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**
8. **Configuration Security**

Provide specific, actionable remediation for each finding with code examples where possible.

**Focus**: Deliver a comprehensive security assessment that development teams can immediately act upon to improve the application's security posture.
