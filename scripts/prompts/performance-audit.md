# **Performance-Focused Code Analysis Prompt for LLM**

## **Instructions**

You are a senior performance engineer specializing in TypeScript/Node.js optimization. I have provided you with pre-analyzed, structured data about a codebase. Your job is to conduct a comprehensive performance audit.

**IMPORTANT**: All code analysis has been completed. You do NOT need to read individual files. Everything you need is in the provided JSON data.

## **Required Files**

Upload these files with your analysis:
1. `llm-analysis-input.json` - Complete structured analysis data
2. `llm-analysis-summary.md` - Human-readable overview

## **Verification Protocol**

Confirm data access by answering from the JSON:
- How many potential performance bottlenecks were identified?
- How many files use async patterns?
- How many large files (>500 lines) exist?
- What is the dependency complexity (files with deps vs. total)?

## **Performance Analysis Framework**

### **1. Bottleneck Identification**
- **Critical Path Analysis**: Review `codeAnalysis.performancePatterns.potentialBottlenecks`
- **Large File Impact**: Analyze `codeAnalysis.qualityIndicators.largeFiles`
- **Complex Algorithm Detection**: Review `codeAnalysis.qualityIndicators.complexFiles`

### **2. Async Pattern Review**
- **Async Implementation**: Examine `codeAnalysis.performancePatterns.asyncPatterns`
- **Concurrency Opportunities**: Analyze file dependencies for parallelization
- **Blocking Operations**: Identify synchronous patterns in async codebase

### **3. Memory & Resource Analysis**
- **Memory Leaks**: Search for potential leak patterns
- **Resource Management**: Review cleanup and disposal patterns
- **Caching Strategy**: Analyze `codeAnalysis.performancePatterns.memoizationFiles`

### **4. Dependency Performance Impact**
- **Hot Path Analysis**: Cross-reference high-dependency files with complexity
- **Bundle Size Impact**: Analyze import patterns and unused dependencies
- **Circular Dependencies**: Review impact on module loading performance

## **Performance-Specific Output Format**

# Performance Audit Report

## Performance Profile Summary
[Based on file sizes, complexity, and dependency patterns]

## Critical Performance Issues
[Detailed analysis of each bottleneck with:]
- **File**: [exact path]
- **Issue Type**: [algorithm, I/O, memory, etc.]
- **Performance Impact**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- **Measurement Guidance**: [how to measure the impact]
- **Optimization Strategy**: [specific optimization with code guidance]

## Async Pattern Assessment
[Review of async implementation quality and optimization opportunities]

## Memory & Resource Management
[Analysis of resource handling and potential leak sources]

## Dependency Performance Impact
[How dependency structure affects runtime performance]

## Optimization Roadmap
### Immediate Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)
### Short-term Optimizations (2-4 weeks)
### Long-term Performance Architecture (1-3 months)

## Performance Metrics & Monitoring
[Recommendations for performance tracking and alerting]

## Performance KPIs
```json
{
  "performance_risk_level": "low|medium|high|critical",
  "critical_bottlenecks": 0,
  "optimization_opportunities": 0,
  "async_pattern_quality": "poor|fair|good|excellent",
  "memory_management_quality": "poor|fair|good|excellent",
  "performance_technical_debt": "high|medium|low"
}
```
```

## **Performance Priority Matrix**

Focus analysis in this order:
1. **Critical Path Bottlenecks** (high-dependency files with complexity)
2. **I/O Operations** (file system, network, database patterns)
3. **Memory-Intensive Operations** (large data processing, loops)
4. **Inefficient Algorithms** (nested loops, expensive operations)
5. **Resource Leaks** (unclosed resources, memory leaks)
6. **Bundle Size Issues** (large dependencies, unused imports)
7. **Concurrency Opportunities** (parallelizable operations)
8. **Caching Gaps** (repeated expensive computations)

## **Optimization Techniques to Consider**

- **Algorithmic Improvements**: Better data structures, reduced complexity
- **Async Optimization**: Proper Promise handling, parallel execution
- **Memory Management**: Object pooling, efficient data structures
- **Caching Strategies**: Memoization, result caching, CDN usage
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading, dynamic imports
- **Bundle Optimization**: Tree shaking, dependency analysis
- **I/O Optimization**: Batching, connection pooling, streaming

Provide specific, measurable optimization recommendations with before/after performance expectations where possible.
