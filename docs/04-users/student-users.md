# Student Users

## User Characteristics

Students learning formal logic in academic settings, typically in courses spanning philosophy, mathematics, computer science, and related disciplines. Exposure ranges from introductory to advanced levels.

## Observed Behaviors and Constraints

### Learning Patterns
- Initial difficulty with symbolic notation systems
- Tendency to conflate syntactic and semantic errors
- Delayed error recognition due to batch validation
- Limited practice due to high effort-to-feedback ratio

### Technical Constraints
- Access primarily through personal devices (laptops, tablets, phones)
- Variable network connectivity in study locations
- Need for compatibility with institutional systems
- Time-constrained usage patterns (between classes, during study sessions)

### Cognitive Load
- Simultaneous learning of logical concepts and tool mechanics
- Difficulty visualizing abstract relationships
- Limited ability to recognize proof patterns
- Challenges connecting formal notation to intuitive understanding

## Functional Requirements

### Interface Progression
- Graduated complexity introduction
- Clear separation of core and advanced features
- Consistent interaction patterns
- Reversible actions for exploration

### Feedback Mechanisms
- Immediate validation of logical steps
- Clear distinction between syntax and logic errors
- Indication of valid next steps
- Progress tracking within problems

### Learning Support
- Multiple representation modes for same content
- Explicit connection to course materials
- Self-paced practice opportunities
- Pattern recognition assistance

### Platform Requirements
- Multi-device synchronization
- Offline capability for practice
- Integration with learning management systems
- Standard file format support

## Usage Context

### Typical Sessions
- Short bursts (15-30 minutes) between classes
- Extended sessions (1-3 hours) for assignments
- Collaborative work during study groups
- Review sessions before examinations

### Learning Progression
- Initial focus on basic proof construction
- Gradual introduction of complex inference rules
- Development of proof strategy recognition
- Advanced work with custom logical systems

## Assessment Integration

### Assignment Workflow
- Problem distribution by instructors
- Individual work with progress saving
- Submission through institutional systems
- Feedback incorporation for revision

### Evaluation Support
- Partial credit for incomplete proofs
