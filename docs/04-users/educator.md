## Profile

Teachers and professors across disciplines who need to teach logical reasoning, from high school philosophy to graduate-level mathematics. They need tools that support both instruction and assessment.

## Current Pain Points

### Teaching Challenges
- Can't see student thinking process
- Grading proofs is time-consuming
- No good visualization tools
- Limited interactive options

### Course Management
- Every instructor starts from scratch
- No sharing between institutions
- Textbook lock-in
- Platform fragmentation

### Student Engagement
- Logic seems dry and abstract
- Students fear making mistakes
- No immediate feedback
- Limited practice opportunities

## What Educators Need

### Classroom Tools
- Present proofs step-by-step
- Highlight logical flow
- Interactive demonstrations
- Student response system

### Assignment Features
- Create problem sets
- Automatic grading options
- Detailed feedback generation
- Progress tracking

### Course Materials
- Shareable lesson plans
- Reusable proof libraries
- Integration with LMS
- Collaborative resources

### Student Insights
- See where students struggle
- Track common mistakes
- Identify teaching opportunities
- Measure understanding

## Success Scenarios

### Engaging Lecture
"I demonstrated De Morgan's laws by dragging and transforming the logical structure in real-time. Students finally 'got it' when they saw the visual transformation."

### Efficient Grading
"What used to take hours now takes minutes. The tool checks logical validity while I focus on creativity and understanding."

### Collaborative Teaching
"Found a perfect proof exercise set created by a colleague in Germany. Adapted it for my students in minutes."

### Student Success
"My pass rates increased 30% after switching to visual proof construction. Students who were lost with symbols thrived with visualization."
