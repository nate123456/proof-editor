# Researcher Users

## Profile

Academic and industry researchers working on formal proofs in mathematics, computer science, philosophy, and other fields. They need powerful tools that don't get in the way of deep thinking.

## Current Pain Points

### Productivity Barriers
- Rewriting similar proofs repeatedly
- Manual management of dependencies
- No good way to refactor
- Lost in notation management

### Collaboration Challenges
- Sharing proofs is difficult
- Version control isn't proof-aware
- Building on others' work is hard
- No standard formats

### Publication Problems
- Pretty-printing for papers
- Maintaining proof validity
- Supplementary materials
- Reproducibility issues

## What Researchers Need

### Power Tools
- Find all usages of a lemma
- Refactor theorem names everywhere
- Navigate complex proof structures
- Automated routine steps

### Collaboration Features
- Git-like version control
- Clear attribution
- Dependency management
- Standard exchange formats

### Publication Support
- Export to LaTeX
- Generate proof sketches
- Interactive supplements
- Archival formats

### Extensibility
- Custom proof strategies
- Domain-specific rules
- Integration with existing tools
- Scriptable automation

## Success Scenarios

### Breakthrough Moment
"I was able to see a connection between two seemingly unrelated lemmas because the tool showed me they both used the same subproof pattern."

### Collaborative Success
"My colleague in Japan extended my proof framework. I pulled their changes and immediately saw how it simplified my main theorem."

### Publication Ready
"Generated the LaTeX for my paper's proofs in minutes. The reviewers could verify everything using the interactive supplement."

### Building on Giants
"Found a 10-year-old proof library that had exactly the foundations I needed. Imported it and started building immediately."

## Research Workflows

### Exploration Phase
- Try multiple approaches
- Keep failed attempts visible
- Branch different strategies
- Quick validation cycles

### Development Phase
- Build on established results
- Refactor for clarity
- Optimize proof length
- Ensure completeness

### Verification Phase
- Automated checking
- Peer review support
- Edge case testing
- Formal verification

### Publication Phase
- Export formats
- Supplementary materials
- Reproducible proofs
- Archival versions

## Design Implications

- **Professional density**: Pack power into the interface
- **Keyboard first**: Researchers live in keyboards
- **Integration points**: Connect with LaTeX, Git, etc.
- **Performance critical**: Handle large proofs smoothly
- **Customization**: Every researcher has preferences
