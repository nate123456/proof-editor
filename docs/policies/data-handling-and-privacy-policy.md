# Data Handling and Privacy Policy

## Overview

This policy governs data collection, storage, synchronization, and privacy protection across all Proof Editor platforms. It establishes clear boundaries for user data handling, encryption requirements, retention policies, and user control mechanisms.

This policy enables the platform's core capabilities—cross-platform synchronization, real-time collaboration, and language package sharing—while maintaining user privacy and data sovereignty.

## Core Privacy Principles

**Data Minimization**: Collect only data essential for platform functionality  
**User Control**: Users maintain authority over their data and sharing preferences  
**Transparency**: Clear disclosure of all data handling practices  
**Purpose Limitation**: Data used only for explicitly stated purposes  
**Security by Design**: Encryption and protection built into all data handling  

## Data Categories and Handling

### Proof Document Data

**What is collected**:
- Proof file contents (atomic arguments, ordered sets, statements)
- Document metadata (creation date, modification history, file size)
- Document structure (tree positions, visual layout)
- Validation results and error states

**Storage locations**:
- **Local**: Primary storage in user's file system
- **Sync cache**: Encrypted temporary storage for cross-platform synchronization
- **No cloud storage**: Platform does not store proof content on remote servers

**Encryption**:
- **At rest**: AES-256 encryption for sync cache files
- **In transit**: TLS 1.3 for all synchronization communications
- **Key management**: User-controlled encryption keys, stored locally

**Retention**:
- **Local files**: User-controlled (standard file system)
- **Sync cache**: Automatically purged after successful synchronization
- **Conflict data**: Retained for 30 days to enable resolution, then automatically deleted

### Cross-Platform Synchronization Data

**Synchronization mechanism**:
- **Direct device-to-device**: No intermediary cloud storage
- **Local network sync**: Wi-Fi Direct or local network when available
- **Encrypted relay**: Minimal relay service for remote sync (data encrypted, server cannot decrypt)

**Sync conflict data**:
- **Temporary storage**: Conflicting versions stored locally during resolution
- **Resolution metadata**: User choices and merge decisions stored with document
- **Automatic cleanup**: Conflict resolution data purged after successful merge

**Network data**:
- **Connection metadata**: Device identifiers for sync pairing (not linked to personal identity)
- **Sync status**: Success/failure states for troubleshooting (no document content)
- **Timing data**: Sync timestamps for conflict resolution (local storage only)

### Real-Time Collaboration Data

**Collaboration session data**:
- **Presence indicators**: Anonymous session identifiers (not linked to personal identity)
- **Cursor positions**: Real-time editing locations (ephemeral, not stored)
- **Edit deltas**: Incremental changes for live collaboration (not persistent)
- **Voice/video**: Not processed by platform (uses user's preferred external service)

**User visibility controls**:
- **Anonymous mode**: Default - no personal information shared
- **Name sharing**: Optional display name (user-controlled)
- **Avatar sharing**: Optional profile image (user-controlled)
- **Contact information**: Never shared without explicit user consent

**Session management**:
- **Session keys**: Ephemeral encryption keys for collaboration (not stored)
- **Participant list**: Temporary session roster (automatically cleared)
