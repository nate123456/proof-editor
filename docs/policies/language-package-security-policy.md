# Language Package Security Policy

## Overview

This policy governs the security framework for language packages containing executable code in Proof Editor. It establishes the consent process, risk disclosure requirements, trust mechanisms, and permission management for user-provided executable code.

This security framework enables the "no gatekeepers" philosophy by empowering users with transparent information and control, allowing them to act as their own informed gatekeepers rather than relying on centralized approval systems.

## Core Security Principle

**User Agency and Informed Consent**: Users must be fully informed about the nature, risks, and implications of executable code before installation, with clear mechanisms for consent, review, and revocation.

## Consent Requirements

### When Consent is Required

Explicit user consent is required for:

1. **Initial Package Installation**: Any package containing executable JavaScript, LSP servers, or validation scripts
2. **Major Version Upgrades**: Packages incrementing major version (e.g., 1.x.x to 2.x.x) that may introduce new executable components
3. **Permission Escalation**: Packages requesting additional capabilities beyond their original scope
4. **Untrusted Sources**: Packages from sources not in the user's trusted publisher list
5. **Dependency Chain Execution**: When a trusted package depends on an untrusted package with executable code

### Consent Information Disclosure

Every consent prompt must clearly display:

#### Package Identity
- **Package name and version** (e.g., "modal-logic-advanced v2.1.0")
- **Publisher/author** with verification status
- **Source location** (GitHub URL, file path, etc.)
- **Digital signature verification** status (when available)

#### Executable Code Details
- **Nature of code**: Explicit description (e.g., "Custom logical validation rules," "Language server for modal logic," "Advanced proof analysis")
- **Code components**: List of executable files and their purposes
- **Execution context**: When and how the code will run

#### Security Environment
- **Sandboxing details**: "This code will run in a secure sandbox with the following restrictions:"
  - No file system access outside package directory
  - No network connectivity
  - Adaptive memory allocation with platform-appropriate limits
  - Execution timeout: 5 seconds per operation
  - No access to other packages or system resources

#### Risk Assessment
- **Potential risks**: "While sandboxed, malicious code could potentially:"
  - Consume system resources (CPU, memory)
  - Interfere with proof validation
  - Access and modify your proof documents
  - Generate misleading logical analysis
- **Mitigation measures**: Explanation of protective safeguards in place
- **User responsibility**: "You should only install packages from sources you trust"

#### Runtime Data Access and Modification
- **Proof data access**: "This package can read and analyze the content of your proof documents"
- **Data modification scope**: "Validation scripts can suggest changes but cannot directly modify your files"
- **Metadata access**: "Package can access document structure, connections, and validation history"
- **Cross-document access**: "Package can analyze relationships between multiple proof documents in your workspace"
- **Privacy implications**: "Package processes your logical reasoning content to provide validation and analysis"

#### Publisher Trust Information
- **Verification status**: 
  - ✅ Verified Publisher (signed, established identity)
  - ⚠️ Community Publisher (unverified but from known source)
  - ❌ Unknown Publisher (no verification, exercise caution)
- **Community reputation**: Rating, download count, community feedback (when available)
- **Previous installations**: "You have previously installed X packages from this publisher"

### Consent UI Requirements

```

#### Consent Actions
- **Install Once**: Install this specific version only
- **Install and Trust Publisher**: Install and add publisher to trusted list for future automatic updates
- **Show Details**: Expand to show full executable code manifest and detailed permissions
- **Cancel**: Abort installation

## Trust Framework

### Publisher Categories

#### Verified Publishers
- **Requirements**: Cryptographic signature verification, established identity
- **Benefits**: 
  - Streamlined consent process for updates
  - Higher visibility in package search
  - Enhanced user confidence indicators
- **Examples**: Academic institutions, established research organizations

#### Community Publishers
- **Requirements**: Consistent GitHub identity, community activity
- **Benefits**: Standard consent process with community reputation display
- **Examples**: Individual researchers, student organizations

#### Unknown Publishers
- **Requirements**: None (anyone can publish)
- **Restrictions**: Enhanced warning messages, no automatic updates
- **Examples**: Anonymous or new contributors

### Trust Establishment Process

#### Publisher Verification
1. **Identity Verification**: Confirm publisher identity through institutional email or established online presence
2. **Code Review**: Initial security review of package contents
3. **Community Validation**: Peer review process for educational/research packages
4. **Signature Verification**: GPG or certificate-based code signing

#### User Trust Management
```typescript
interface UserTrustSettings {
  trustedPublishers: string[];
  blockedPublishers: string[];
  autoUpdateFromTrusted: boolean;
  requireVerificationForAcademic: boolean;
  warnOnUnknownPublishers: boolean;
}
```

## Permission Management

### Permission Categories

#### Core Permissions (Always Required)
- **Document Access**: Read and modify proof documents
- **Validation Execution**: Run logical validation on user's proofs
- **UI Integration**: Display results and interact with proof editor

#### Extended Permissions (Require Justification)
- **Language Server**: Host persistent LSP server for advanced features
- **External Integration**: Access external services for enhanced analysis
- **Custom UI**: Add new interface elements or modify existing ones
- **Data Export**: Export proof data in custom formats

#### Restricted Permissions (Special Approval)
- **System Integration**: Interact with platform-specific features
- **Network Access**: Connect to external services (for AI/cloud features)
- **File System**: Access files outside package scope

### Permission Lifecycle

#### Initial Grant
- Permissions requested during installation
- User consents to specific permission set
- Permissions stored in user profile

#### Permission Review
```typescript
interface PackagePermissions {
  packageId: string;
  version: string;
  grantedPermissions: Permission[];
  grantDate: Date;
  lastReviewDate: Date;
  autoUpdateConsent: boolean;
}
```

#### Permission Revocation
- User can review and revoke permissions at any time
- Graceful degradation when permissions removed
- Clear indication of affected functionality

## Security Enforcement

### Sandboxing Implementation

#### JavaScript Execution Environment
```typescript
interface SandboxConstraints {
  // Resource limits
  memoryAllocation: 'adaptive'; // Based on system resources and proof complexity
  maxExecutionTimeMs: 5000;
  maxCPUUsage: 50; // percentage
  
  // Access restrictions
  allowFileSystemAccess: false;
  allowNetworkAccess: false;
  allowSystemCalls: false;
  
  // Proof Editor API access
  allowedAPIs: [
    'proof.validate',
    'proof.analyze',
    'ui.showMessage'
  ];
}
```

#### LSP Server Constraints
- Process isolation on desktop platforms
- Memory and CPU limits enforced by platform
- Communication restricted to LSP protocol only
- No direct file system access outside package directory

### Monitoring and Compliance

#### Runtime Monitoring
- Resource usage tracking
- Permission violation detection
- Suspicious behavior analysis
- User notification of violations

#### Audit Trail
```typescript
interface SecurityAuditLog {
  packageId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  action: 'install' | 'execute' | 'permission_check' | 'violation';
  details: string;
  userConsent: boolean;
  riskLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
}
```

## Incident Response

### Violation Detection
- Automatic detection of sandbox escapes
- Resource limit breaches
- Unauthorized API access attempts
- Suspicious network activity

### Response Actions
1. **Immediate**: Terminate package execution
2. **User Notification**: Alert user of security violation
3. **Package Quarantine**: Disable package pending review
4. **Community Alert**: Report to package repository if applicable

### User Remediation
