# Evaluation Criteria

## System Evaluation Framework

The platform's effectiveness can be evaluated along several dimensions that align with its stated purpose and design constraints.

## Functional Criteria

### Logical Correctness
- Proofs constructed in the system are verifiable through formal methods
- User-defined logic systems maintain internal consistency
- Translation between systems preserves semantic meaning
- Error detection accurately identifies logical flaws

### Representational Adequacy
- Visual representations maintain one-to-one correspondence with logical structures
- Spatial arrangements preserve and communicate logical relationships
- Complex proofs remain comprehensible through hierarchical organization
- Multiple valid representations are supported for the same logical content

### System Extensibility
- New logical systems can be defined without modifying core platform
- Existing systems can be composed and extended
- Domain-specific requirements can be accommodated
- Inter-system translation maintains logical validity

## Usability Criteria

### Learnability
- Time required to construct first valid proof
- Progression from simple to complex proof construction
- Error recovery and understanding
- Transfer of skills between different logical systems

### Efficiency
- Time to complete common proof construction tasks
- Reduction in mechanical errors compared to text-based methods
- Reuse of proof components and patterns
- Navigation speed in large proof structures

### Multi-Platform Accessibility
- Feature parity across desktop, tablet, mobile, and web
- Touch interfaces as capable as keyboard/mouse
- Seamless workflow transitions between devices
- Visual clarity from 5" phones to 32" monitors
- Gesture support matching platform conventions
- Voice input where platform supports
- Offline functionality on all platforms
- Performance acceptable on entry-level devices

## Community Criteria

### Cross-Platform Adoption Patterns
- Logic systems shareable via QR codes in classrooms
- Mobile contributions to proof libraries
- Field researchers using tablets for on-site work
- Students practicing on phones between classes
