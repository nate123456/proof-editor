# Purpose

## Project Purpose

Proof Editor is a platform for constructing and analyzing logical reasoning through visual representation of atomic arguments and argument trees, incorporating integrated development environment (IDE) capabilities and supporting user-defined logical systems.

## Core Components

### Visual Representation
- Spatial arrangement of logical elements
- Direct manipulation interface
- Hierarchical complexity management
- Graphical notation system

### Development Environment Features
- Symbol and reference tracking
- Automated error detection
- Structural refactoring capabilities
- Navigation and search functionality

### Extensible Logic Framework
- User-defined logical systems
- Modular rule definitions
- System composition and inheritance
- Inter-system translation capabilities

## Target Users

The platform serves individuals and groups working with formal reasoning:
- Students learning formal logic
- Educators teaching logical reasoning
- Researchers developing and verifying proofs
- Professionals applying formal methods
- Communities creating domain-specific reasoning tools

## Design Constraints

The platform operates under these constraints:
- Logical correctness must be verifiable
- Visual representation must preserve semantic meaning
- User-defined systems must maintain internal consistency
- Interface complexity must scale with user expertise
