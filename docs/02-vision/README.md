# Project Vision

## Purpose

Proof Editor is a focused two-platform system for constructing and analyzing logical reasoning through visual representation of atomic arguments and argument trees, bringing modern development capabilities to formal logic through VS Code Extension and React Native App while supporting user-defined logical systems.

The platform combines three key innovations that work together to create a unified environment for formal reasoning across diverse domains:
- Visual representation of logical structures
- Integrated development environment capabilities adapted for formal reasoning  
- User-definable logical systems with sharing mechanisms

### Why This Matters

Formal reasoning happens everywhere - classrooms, research labs, field sites, courtrooms, and commutes. Yet current tools assume users are at desktop computers with keyboards. Proof Editor meets users wherever they think, with full functionality on their available device:

- Students practicing logic on phones during commutes
- Educators demonstrating concepts on classroom tablets
- Researchers sketching proofs on mobile devices in the field
- Professionals reviewing arguments on any available device
- Remote teams collaborating across different platforms
- Communities building tools regardless of their hardware

### Core Components

**Visual Representation**
- Touch-optimized spatial arrangement on mobile devices
- Mouse-and-keyboard precision on desktop platforms
- Direct manipulation adapted to each input method
- Responsive layouts from phone to ultra-wide displays
- Progressive rendering for device capabilities

**Multi-Platform Development Features**
- Real-time synchronization across devices
- Offline-first architecture for mobile reliability
- Platform-appropriate UI paradigms
- Cloud-based collaboration with local performance
- Symbol tracking that works everywhere

**Extensible Logic Framework**
- User-defined logical systems
- Modular rule definitions
- System composition and inheritance
- Inter-system translation capabilities

## Design Principles

These principles guide every decision in the platform's design and development.

### 1. Multi-Platform Visual Primacy

**Adaptive Spatial Representation:** Logical relationships adapt to available screen space and input methods, from phone screens to multi-monitor setups. Touch gestures, mouse precision, and keyboard shortcuts all manipulate the same underlying logical structures. Statements remain consistent while their visual arrangement responds to platform capabilities.

**Platform-Aware Direct Manipulation:** Touch interfaces use gestures for connection and arrangement. Desktop interfaces leverage precise mouse control and keyboard shortcuts. Mobile devices employ innovative touch patterns. Each platform's strengths are utilized while maintaining conceptual consistency.

### 2. Universal Complexity Management

**Device-Responsive Progressive Interface:** Interface complexity scales with both user expertise and device capabilities. Phones show essential features prominently. Tablets add intermediate tools. Desktops expose full professional capabilities. Users carry their expertise level across devices.

**Contextual Information:** Documentation and guidance are embedded within the interface at points of use. Learning resources are integrated with functional elements.

### 3. Computational Assistance

**Automated Analysis:** The system performs continuous validation, error detection, and pattern recognition. Computational processes operate in parallel with user interaction.

**User Autonomy:** Automated features operate as optional enhancements. Users retain full control over acceptance or rejection of computational suggestions.

### 4. Information Sharing

**Default Visibility:** Created content is shareable unless explicitly restricted. Sharing mechanisms support both complete systems and modular components.

**Compositional Reuse:** Existing work can be extended, modified, and incorporated into new constructions. Attribution and versioning are automatically maintained.

### 5. Logical Pluralism

**System Neutrality:** No particular logical system receives preferential treatment in the platform design. All user-defined systems operate within the same framework.

**Extensible Architecture:** Core platform provides fundamental operations; specific logical systems are implemented as extensions. New systems can be created without platform modification.

### 6. Formal Rigor

**Platform-Independent Correctness:** Logical validity is preserved identically across all platforms. Touch simplifications, mobile optimizations, and responsive layouts never compromise formal correctness. The same proof means the same thing everywhere.

**Multiple Representations:** The same logical content can be represented in multiple forms. Users select representation modes appropriate to their needs and expertise.

### 7. Distributed Development

**User-Driven Evolution:** Platform development responds to observed usage patterns and explicit user feedback. Feature prioritization reflects actual use cases.

**Modular Contributions:** System architecture supports contributions at multiple granularities. Changes can be isolated to specific components.

### 8. True Platform Independence

**Platform Parity:**
- Desktop: Full keyboard/mouse precision with multi-window workflows
- Tablet: Touch-optimized with stylus support for natural drawing
- Mobile: Gesture-based with smart space utilization
- Web: Progressive enhancement with offline capabilities

**Local-First, Sync-Enabled:** Every device maintains full offline functionality. Changes synchronize seamlessly when connected. No feature requires constant connectivity. Work continues uninterrupted regardless of network availability.
