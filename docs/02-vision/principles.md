# Design Principles

## 1. Multi-Platform Visual Primacy

### Adaptive Spatial Representation
Logical relationships adapt to available screen space and input methods, from phone screens to multi-monitor setups. Touch gestures, mouse precision, and keyboard shortcuts all manipulate the same underlying logical structures. Statements remain consistent while their visual arrangement responds to platform capabilities.

### Platform-Aware Direct Manipulation
Touch interfaces use gestures for connection and arrangement. Desktop interfaces leverage precise mouse control and keyboard shortcuts. Mobile devices employ innovative touch patterns. Each platform's strengths are utilized while maintaining conceptual consistency.

## 2. Universal Complexity Management

### Device-Responsive Progressive Interface
Interface complexity scales with both user expertise and device capabilities. Phones show essential features prominently. Tablets add intermediate tools. Desktops expose full professional capabilities. Users carry their expertise level across devices.

### Contextual Information
Documentation and guidance are embedded within the interface at points of use. Learning resources are integrated with functional elements.

## 3. Computational Assistance

### Automated Analysis
The system performs continuous validation, error detection, and pattern recognition. Computational processes operate in parallel with user interaction.

### User Autonomy
Automated features operate as optional enhancements. Users retain full control over acceptance or rejection of computational suggestions.

## 4. Information Sharing

### Default Visibility
Created content is shareable unless explicitly restricted. Sharing mechanisms support both complete systems and modular components.

### Compositional Reuse
Existing work can be extended, modified, and incorporated into new constructions. Attribution and versioning are automatically maintained.

## 5. Logical Pluralism

### System Neutrality
No particular logical system receives preferential treatment in the platform design. All user-defined systems operate within the same framework.

### Extensible Architecture
Core platform provides fundamental operations; specific logical systems are implemented as extensions. New systems can be created without platform modification.

## 6. Formal Rigor

### Platform-Independent Correctness
Logical validity is preserved identically across all platforms. Touch simplifications, mobile optimizations, and responsive layouts never compromise formal correctness. The same proof means the same thing everywhere.

### Multiple Representations
The same logical content can be represented in multiple forms. Users select representation modes appropriate to their needs and expertise.

## 7. Distributed Development

### User-Driven Evolution
Platform development responds to observed usage patterns and explicit user feedback. Feature prioritization reflects actual use cases.

### Modular Contributions
System architecture supports contributions at multiple granularities. Changes can be isolated to specific components.

## 8. True Platform Independence

### Universal Access Philosophy
Formal reasoning happens everywhere - classrooms, research labs, field sites, courtrooms, and commutes. The platform meets users wherever they think, with full functionality on their available device.

### Platform Parity
- Desktop: Full keyboard/mouse precision with multi-window workflows
- Tablet: Touch-optimized with stylus support for natural drawing
- Mobile: Gesture-based with smart space utilization
- Web: Progressive enhancement with offline capabilities

### Local-First, Sync-Enabled
Every device maintains full offline functionality. Changes synchronize seamlessly when connected. No feature requires constant connectivity. Work continues uninterrupted regardless of network availability.
