# Design Principles

## 1. Visual Primacy

### Spatial Representation
Logical relationships are displayed through spatial arrangement and visual connections, while symbolic notation captures the logical content itself. Both work together: Statements (reusable text entities) express logical content, spatial arrangement shows their relationships through shared usage.

### Direct Manipulation
Interface elements can be repositioned, connected, and modified through direct interaction. The manipulation metaphor corresponds to the conceptual operation being performed.

## 2. Complexity Management

### Progressive Interface
Interface complexity scales with user expertise. Initial interactions expose core functionality; advanced features become available as usage patterns indicate readiness.

### Contextual Information
Documentation and guidance are embedded within the interface at points of use. Learning resources are integrated with functional elements.

## 3. Computational Assistance

### Automated Analysis
The system performs continuous validation, error detection, and pattern recognition. Computational processes operate in parallel with user interaction.

### User Autonomy
Automated features operate as optional enhancements. Users retain full control over acceptance or rejection of computational suggestions.

## 4. Information Sharing

### Default Visibility
Created content is shareable unless explicitly restricted. Sharing mechanisms support both complete systems and modular components.

### Compositional Reuse
Existing work can be extended, modified, and incorporated into new constructions. Attribution and versioning are automatically maintained.

## 5. Logical Pluralism

### System Neutrality
No particular logical system receives preferential treatment in the platform design. All user-defined systems operate within the same framework.

### Extensible Architecture
Core platform provides fundamental operations; specific logical systems are implemented as extensions. New systems can be created without platform modification.

## 6. Formal Rigor

### Correctness Preservation
All operations maintain logical validity. Accessibility features do not compromise formal correctness.

### Multiple Representations
The same logical content can be represented in multiple forms. Users select representation modes appropriate to their needs and expertise.

## 7. Distributed Development

### User-Driven Evolution
Platform development responds to observed usage patterns and explicit user feedback. Feature prioritization reflects actual use cases.

### Modular Contributions
System architecture supports contributions at multiple granularities. Changes can be isolated to specific components.

## 8. Platform Independence

### Device Agnosticism
Functionality is available across different device categories and operating systems. Interface adapts to available input methods and display characteristics.

### Local-First Operation
Core functionality operates without network connectivity. Synchronization occurs when connections are available.
