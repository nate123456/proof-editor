# Platform Adapter Specifications

## Introduction

This document describes the conceptual design of platform adapters that form the abstraction layer between Proof Editor's core business logic and platform-specific implementations. Rather than defining specific interfaces, this document explains the responsibilities and design considerations for each adapter category.

## Adapter Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Minimal Surface Area**: Each adapter exposes only what the core logic needs
- **Platform Agnostic**: Abstractions don't leak platform-specific concepts
- **Async by Default**: All I/O operations are asynchronous
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of platform limitations
- **Resource Management**: Clear lifecycle and cleanup patterns

### Common Patterns
All adapters follow consistent patterns:
- **Initialization**: Platform-specific setup and configuration
- **Operation**: Core functionality exposed through simple abstractions
- **Observation**: Event-based updates for reactive behavior
- **Cleanup**: Proper resource disposal and lifecycle management

## File System Abstraction

### Purpose
Provides platform-independent file and directory operations while respecting platform constraints like mobile sandboxing.

### Key Responsibilities
- **Basic Operations**: Read, write, delete files with consistent behavior
- **Directory Management**: Create and navigate directory structures
- **Path Handling**: Abstract platform-specific path conventions
- **File Watching**: Monitor changes with platform-appropriate mechanisms

### Design Considerations
- **Sandboxing**: Mobile platforms restrict file access to app directories
- **Permissions**: Handle platform permission models transparently
- **Performance**: Optimize for platform I/O characteristics
- **Error Handling**: Consistent errors across different file systems

### Platform Differences
- **VS Code**: Direct file system access with full paths and VS Code workspace integration
- **React Native**: Sandboxed storage with platform-appropriate document providers

## Settings Management

### Purpose
Manages application configuration and user preferences across different platform storage mechanisms.

### Key Responsibilities
- **Value Storage**: Store and retrieve typed configuration values
- **Scoping**: Support global, workspace, and document-level settings
- **Persistence**: Ensure settings survive app restarts
- **Migration**: Handle settings schema evolution

### Design Considerations
- **Storage Backend**: Key-value stores, files, or platform APIs
- **Synchronization**: Settings sync across devices (when applicable)
- **Performance**: Cache frequently accessed values
- **Type Safety**: Preserve type information across serialization

### Platform Differences
- **VS Code**: Leverages built-in settings infrastructure with workspace hierarchy
- **React Native**: Uses AsyncStorage with encrypted secure storage for sensitive data

## User Interface Abstraction

### Purpose
Provides platform-appropriate UI components and interaction patterns while maintaining consistent functionality.

### Key Responsibilities
- **Notifications**: Display messages, alerts, and confirmations
- **Input Collection**: Gather user input through appropriate controls
- **Progress Indication**: Show ongoing operation status
- **Document Display**: Present proof documents effectively

### Design Considerations
- **Input Methods**: Mouse/keyboard vs touch interactions
- **Screen Sizes**: Responsive layouts for different devices
- **Platform Conventions**: Follow native UI patterns
- **Accessibility**: Support platform accessibility features

### Interaction Patterns
- **Desktop**: Keyboard shortcuts, context menus, hover states
- **Mobile**: Touch gestures, long press, swipe actions
- **Hybrid**: Support both input methods where available

## LSP Communication

### Purpose
Manages Language Server Protocol communication across different transport mechanisms and platform constraints.

### Key Responsibilities
- **Server Lifecycle**: Start, stop, and monitor language servers
- **Message Exchange**: Send requests and handle responses
- **Document Synchronization**: Keep server and client in sync
- **Custom Extensions**: Support proof-specific LSP extensions

### Design Considerations
- **Transport Flexibility**: Support stdio, TCP, WebSocket
- **Connection Reliability**: Handle disconnections and reconnections
- **Performance**: Minimize latency and bandwidth usage
- **Offline Support**: Graceful degradation without servers

### Platform Strategies
- **VS Code**: Local process spawning with stdio/pipe communication through VS Code LSP client
- **React Native**: WebSocket connections to remote servers or embedded LSP service

## Command System

### Purpose
Provides a unified way to register and execute commands across different platform interaction models.

### Key Responsibilities
- **Command Registration**: Define available actions
- **Execution**: Trigger commands with parameters
- **Discovery**: Help users find commands
- **Context Sensitivity**: Enable/disable based on state

### Design Considerations
- **Invocation Methods**: Keyboard, menu, gesture, voice
- **Discoverability**: Command palettes, menus, hints
- **Customization**: User-defined shortcuts and bindings
- **Undo/Redo**: Integrate with command history

### Platform Adaptations
- **Desktop**: Keyboard shortcuts, command palette, menus
- **Mobile**: Touch gestures, action sheets, floating buttons
- **Accessibility**: Alternative invocation methods

## Package Management

### Purpose
Handles installation and management of logic system packages across different distribution mechanisms.

### Key Responsibilities
- **Package Discovery**: Find available packages
- **Installation**: Download and install packages
- **Updates**: Manage package versions
- **Dependencies**: Resolve and install requirements

### Design Considerations
- **Distribution Methods**: Marketplaces, direct downloads, git
- **Security**: Verify package integrity and safety
- **Storage**: Efficient package storage and caching
- **Offline Usage**: Support offline package usage

### Platform Approaches
- **VS Code**: Extension marketplace integration
- **Mobile**: App store policies and restrictions
- **Direct Distribution**: GitHub-based package sharing

## Language System Management

### Purpose
Manages logic system language configurations and their associated language servers.

### Key Responsibilities
- **Language Discovery**: Find available logic systems
- **Configuration**: Manage language-specific settings
- **Server Management**: Handle language server lifecycles
- **Version Control**: Support multiple language versions

### Design Considerations
- **Dynamic Loading**: Hot-swapping languages without restart
- **Compatibility**: Ensure language/document compatibility
- **Resource Management**: Handle multiple active languages
- **Fallbacks**: Graceful handling of missing languages

## Theme Integration

### Purpose
Provides consistent theming across platforms while respecting platform-specific appearance systems.

### Key Responsibilities
- **Theme Application**: Apply color schemes consistently
- **Dynamic Themes**: Support light/dark mode switching
- **Custom Themes**: Allow user-defined themes
- **Platform Integration**: Respect system appearance settings

### Design Considerations
- **Color Systems**: Map abstract colors to platform colors
- **Accessibility**: Ensure sufficient contrast and readability
- **Performance**: Efficient theme switching
- **Consistency**: Maintain visual coherence across platforms

## Implementation Guidelines

### Testing Strategy
Each adapter should be tested at three levels:
1. **Contract Tests**: Verify adapter behavior matches expectations
2. **Integration Tests**: Ensure platform integration works correctly
3. **Mock Implementations**: Provide test doubles for core logic testing

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Features should fail gracefully
- **Clear Error Messages**: Help users understand issues
- **Recovery Options**: Provide ways to recover from errors
- **Logging**: Capture diagnostic information appropriately

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Initialize only when needed
- **Caching**: Cache expensive operations appropriately
- **Batch Operations**: Group related operations
- **Resource Limits**: Respect platform constraints

## Evolution and Extensibility

The adapter pattern allows for:
- **New Platform Support**: Add platforms without changing core logic
- **Feature Enhancement**: Extend adapters with new capabilities
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with older platforms
- **Gradual Migration**: Update platforms independently

This architectural approach ensures Proof Editor can adapt to new platforms and technologies while maintaining a stable core that embodies the essential proof editing functionality.
