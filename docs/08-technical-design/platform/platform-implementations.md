# Platform Implementation Strategies

## Introduction

This document describes the conceptual approaches for implementing the platform abstraction layer on different platforms. Rather than providing code examples, it focuses on architectural patterns, platform-specific considerations, and implementation strategies.

## VS Code Platform Strategy

### Overview
The VS Code implementation leverages the rich extension API ecosystem to provide a full-featured IDE experience for proof editing. The strategy focuses on thin wrappers around existing VS Code functionality rather than reimplementing features.

### Architectural Approach

#### Direct API Utilization
- **Philosophy**: Use VS Code APIs directly with minimal abstraction overhead
- **Benefits**: Maintains compatibility with VS Code ecosystem
- **Challenges**: API changes require adapter updates
- **Strategy**: Version-aware adapters that handle API evolution

#### Extension Integration
- **Workspace Integration**: Leverage VS Code's workspace and folder concepts
- **Settings System**: Use VS Code's configuration hierarchy
- **Command Palette**: Integrate with existing command infrastructure
- **UI Components**: Utilize WebViews for custom visualizations

### Key Implementation Patterns

#### File System Integration
- Uses VS Code's virtual file system API for maximum flexibility
- Supports remote development scenarios transparently
- Integrates with VS Code's file watching infrastructure
- Respects workspace trust and security policies

#### UI/UX Approach
- WebView-based proof visualization for rich interactivity
- Native VS Code UI elements for familiarity
- Theme integration for consistent appearance
- Activity bar and panel integration for workflow

#### Language Server Integration
- Leverages VS Code's built-in LSP client infrastructure
- Supports multiple concurrent language servers
- Automatic server lifecycle management
- Integrates with VS Code's diagnostics and IntelliSense

### Platform-Specific Optimizations
- Lazy loading of heavy components
- Efficient WebView communication protocols
- Incremental rendering for large proofs
- Integration with VS Code's extension host architecture

## React Native Platform Strategy

### Overview
The React Native implementation provides a native mobile experience optimized for touch interaction while maintaining feature parity with the desktop version. The strategy emphasizes mobile-first design patterns and platform-native behaviors.

### Architectural Approach

#### Native Component Utilization
- **Philosophy**: Use platform-native components for better performance
- **Benefits**: Native look and feel on iOS and Android
- **Challenges**: Platform differences require careful abstraction
- **Strategy**: Shared components with platform-specific implementations

#### Mobile-First Design
- **Touch Optimization**: All interactions designed for finger input
- **Gesture Support**: Native gesture recognizers for fluid interaction
- **Responsive Layouts**: Adaptive to different screen sizes and orientations
- **Offline-First**: Full functionality without constant connectivity

### Key Implementation Patterns

#### File System Approach
- Sandboxed storage with secure document management
- Document provider integration for external file access
- Efficient caching strategies for performance
- Cloud synchronization support where available

#### Touch Interaction Design
- Expanded touch targets for reliable interaction
- Context menus optimized for thumb reach
- Gesture-based navigation and editing
- Haptic feedback for important actions

#### Network-Based LSP
- WebSocket communication to remote language servers
- Connection pooling and management
- Offline queue for pending validations
- Efficient message batching

### Platform-Specific Considerations

#### iOS Implementation
- Leverages iOS document browser for file management
- Integrates with iOS share sheet for document sharing
- Supports iPad-specific features (multitasking, Apple Pencil)
- Respects iOS app lifecycle and background restrictions

#### Android Implementation
- Material Design compliance for familiar UX
- Storage Access Framework for file operations
- Adaptive icons and themed components
- Power management awareness

### Performance Optimizations

#### Memory Management
- Aggressive view recycling for large proof trees
- Lazy loading of proof branches
- Image and resource optimization
- Memory pressure handling

#### Battery Optimization
- Reduced refresh rates on low battery
- Batched network operations
- Dark mode for OLED displays
- CPU throttling awareness

#### Rendering Performance
- Native animation drivers for smooth interactions
- Virtualized lists for large data sets
- Incremental rendering strategies
- Off-screen rendering for complex visualizations

## Cross-Platform Considerations

### Shared Patterns
Both platforms benefit from common architectural patterns:

#### Dependency Injection
- Platform services injected at initialization
- Mock services for testing
- Runtime platform detection
- Graceful feature degradation

#### Event-Driven Architecture
- Consistent event patterns across platforms
- Platform-appropriate event dispatching
- Unified event handling in core logic
- Performance monitoring hooks

#### Resource Management
- Explicit lifecycle management
- Resource pooling where appropriate
- Cleanup guarantees
- Memory leak prevention

### Platform Initialization

#### Bootstrap Sequence
1. **Platform Detection**: Identify runtime environment
2. **Service Creation**: Instantiate platform-specific services
3. **Core Initialization**: Create platform-agnostic core with services
4. **UI Setup**: Initialize platform-appropriate UI
5. **Feature Activation**: Enable platform-specific features

#### Configuration Management
- Platform-specific default configurations
- Migration paths for settings
- Feature flags for platform capabilities
- Performance tuning parameters

### Testing Strategies

#### Platform-Specific Testing
- **VS Code**: Extension testing framework integration
- **React Native**: Native testing tools and simulators
- **Shared Tests**: Core logic tests run on both platforms
- **Integration Tests**: Platform service integration verification

#### Quality Assurance
- Automated UI testing for critical workflows
- Performance benchmarking per platform
- Memory and resource usage profiling
- Cross-platform document compatibility testing

## Migration and Compatibility

### Code Organization
- Clear separation between platform and core code
- Shared type definitions and interfaces
- Platform-specific entry points
- Common utility functions

### Build and Deployment
- **VS Code**: Standard extension packaging and distribution
- **React Native**: Platform-specific app store deployment
- **Shared Assets**: Common resources packaged appropriately
- **Version Alignment**: Coordinated releases across platforms

### Feature Parity Strategy
- Core features identical across platforms
- Platform-specific enhancements where appropriate
- Graceful degradation for platform limitations
- Clear documentation of platform differences

## Future Platform Considerations

### Web Platform
- Progressive Web App architecture
- WebAssembly for performance-critical code
- IndexedDB for local storage
- Service Workers for offline support

### Desktop Application
- Electron-based standalone application
- Native menu integration
- OS-specific features (jump lists, dock integration)
- Auto-update mechanisms

### Emerging Platforms
- Tablet-optimized interfaces
- Voice-controlled interactions
- AR/VR proof visualization
- Collaborative editing support

This implementation strategy ensures that each platform can leverage its unique strengths while maintaining a consistent core experience for proof editing across all environments.
