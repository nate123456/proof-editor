# Technical Design

## Overview

This section contains detailed technical specifications for the Proof Editor platform. While the conceptual documentation describes what the system does, these documents specify exactly how it works at an implementation level.

## Contents

### [Conceptual Data Model](conceptual-data-model.md)
Entity-relationship model showing the core entities and their relationships, maintaining alignment with the project's conceptual vision while addressing implementation needs. Covers the ordered set-based data model where connections emerge from shared ordered set references.

## Design Approach

These technical specifications:
- Define concrete data structures with types
- Address performance and scalability concerns  
- Specify algorithms and operations
- Consider edge cases and error conditions
- Provide clear implementation guidance

## Relationship to Concepts

Each technical design document maps directly to concepts defined in the [Core Concepts](../03-concepts/README.md) section, providing the engineering details needed for implementation.
