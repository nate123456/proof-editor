# Current Limitations of Logic Tools

## Representation Constraints

### Symbolic Notation Dependency
- Primary interaction through text-based symbolic notation
- Limited visual representation of logical structures
- Syntax requirements independent of logical content
- No direct manipulation of logical relationships

### Feedback Latency
- Validation occurs after construction completion
- No intermediate state verification
- Error detection delayed until submission
- Limited guidance during construction process

## Operational Constraints

### Manual Processes
- Repeated construction of similar proof patterns
- No pattern recognition or reuse mechanisms
- Manual copying introduces transcription errors
- Limited automation of mechanical steps

### Limited Navigation
- No systematic tracking of symbol usage
- Cannot trace dependencies between statements
- No search functionality across proof structures
- Manual maintenance of reference relationships

### Tool Fragmentation
- Separate applications for construction, validation, and presentation
- Information loss during format conversion
- Version control systems not adapted to proof structures
- No integrated workflow support

## Sharing Limitations

### Distribution Mechanisms
- No standardized format for proof library distribution
- Repeated implementation of fundamental theorems
- No dependency management for logical constructions
- Limited mechanisms for building on existing work

### Domain Isolation
- Logic tools specific to narrow domains
- No translation between different logical systems
- Limited knowledge transfer across fields
- Domain-specific tools developed independently

## Technical Constraints

### Platform Accessibility
- Most tools confined to desktop environments
- No mobile or tablet support for field work or classroom use
- Web-based tools require constant connectivity
- Platform-specific file formats prevent cross-device workflows
- Touch interfaces completely unsupported
- No offline capabilities for remote or mobile scenarios

### System Rigidity
- Fixed logical systems built into tools
- No mechanism for user-defined inference rules
- Cannot extend existing systems
- New systems require complete reimplementation
- Platform lock-in prevents switching environments
- No progressive web capabilities for gradual feature access

## Usage Patterns

### Academic Desktop Bias
- Tools assume powerful desktop computers
- No consideration for mobile learning scenarios
- Field researchers cannot use tools on-site
- Students limited to computer labs
- Practitioners need desktop access for basic tasks
- No support for quick mobile consultations

### Infrastructure Absence
- No cross-platform package management
- Platform-specific distribution mechanisms
- No universal sharing protocols
- Version control limited to desktop tools
- Mobile users cannot contribute to libraries
- Each platform requires separate implementations
