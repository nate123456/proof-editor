# Current Limitations of Logic Tools

## Representation Constraints

### Symbolic Notation Dependency
- Primary interaction through text-based symbolic notation
- Limited visual representation of logical structures
- Syntax requirements independent of logical content
- No direct manipulation of logical relationships

### Feedback Latency
- Validation occurs after construction completion
- No intermediate state verification
- Error detection delayed until submission
- Limited guidance during construction process

## Operational Constraints

### Manual Processes
- Repeated construction of similar proof patterns
- No pattern recognition or reuse mechanisms
- Manual copying introduces transcription errors
- Limited automation of mechanical steps

### Limited Navigation
- No systematic tracking of symbol usage
- Cannot trace dependencies between statements
- No search functionality across proof structures
- Manual maintenance of reference relationships

### Tool Fragmentation
- Separate applications for construction, validation, and presentation
- Information loss during format conversion
- Version control systems not adapted to proof structures
- No integrated workflow support

## Sharing Limitations

### Distribution Mechanisms
- No standardized format for proof library distribution
- Repeated implementation of fundamental theorems
- No dependency management for logical constructions
- Limited mechanisms for building on existing work

### Domain Isolation
- Logic tools specific to narrow domains
- No translation between different logical systems
- Limited knowledge transfer across fields
- Domain-specific tools developed independently

## Technical Constraints

### Platform Restrictions
- Tools limited to specific operating systems
- No mobile device support
- Network connectivity required for operation
- Platform-specific file formats

### System Rigidity
- Fixed logical systems built into tools
- No mechanism for user-defined inference rules
- Cannot extend existing systems
- New systems require complete reimplementation

## Usage Patterns

### Academic Focus
- Tools optimized for theoretical applications
- Limited support for practical reasoning tasks
- Missing domain-specific requirements
- Interface complexity assumes expert knowledge

### Infrastructure Absence
- No package management for logical systems
- No central repository for sharing
- No versioning for logic definitions
- Each implementation starts from base principles
