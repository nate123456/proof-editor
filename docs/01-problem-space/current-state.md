# Current State of Logic Tools

## Traditional Approaches

### Paper and Pencil
- Still the default for most students and researchers
- Works anywhere but lacks computational support
- No validation or error checking
- Difficult to reorganize or refactor
- Cannot transition between paper and digital
- Impossible to share or collaborate effectively

### Text-Based Proof Assistants
- Coq, Isabelle, Lean, Agda
- Desktop-only, requiring powerful machines
- No mobile or tablet versions
- Steep learning curve with keyboard-centric interfaces
- Syntax-heavy, not visual or touch-friendly
- Built for experts with desktop setups
- Limited to specific logic systems

### Educational Software
- Platform-specific implementations
- Cannot transition from mobile learning to desktop work
- Often oversimplified with no growth path
- Fixed logic systems
- No cross-device synchronization
- Poor collaboration features
- Disconnect from professional tools

## What's Missing

### Universal Access
Formal logic tools remain trapped on desktop platforms while learning and reasoning happen everywhere - classrooms, field sites, commutes, and collaborative spaces. No tool bridges mobile exploration with desktop deep work.

### Modern Development Features
While programmers enjoy IntelliSense, refactoring, and collaborative features across all devices, logic practitioners are confined to desktop-only static text environments.

### Community and Sharing
No cross-platform package ecosystem for logic systems. Desktop tools can't share with mobile learners. Each textbook, course, and research project rebuilds from scratch on each platform.

### Domain Flexibility
Tools are built for specific logic systems on specific platforms. A medical researcher can't create diagnostic rules on a tablet during rounds, nor can a lawyer formalize arguments on their phone during court preparation.

## The Result

- **Students** can't practice logic on their phones between classes
- **Researchers** are chained to desktop computers for proof work
- **Field workers** cannot apply formal methods on-site
- **Professionals** avoid formal methods due to platform constraints
- **Teachers** can't demonstrate concepts on tablets in classrooms
- **Domains** remain disconnected from logical reasoning tools
