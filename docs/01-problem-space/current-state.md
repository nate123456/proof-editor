# Current State of Logic Tools

## Traditional Approaches

### Paper and Pencil
- Still the default for most students and researchers
- No validation or error checking
- Difficult to reorganize or refactor
- Impossible to share or collaborate effectively

### Text-Based Proof Assistants
- Coq, Isabelle, Lean, Agda
- Powerful but steep learning curve
- Syntax-heavy, not visual
- Built for experts, not learners
- Limited to specific logic systems

### Educational Software
- Often oversimplified
- Fixed logic systems
- No extensibility
- Poor collaboration features
- Disconnect from professional tools

## What's Missing

### Visual Understanding
Current tools prioritize symbolic notation over visual comprehension. Complex proof structures become walls of text rather than intuitive diagrams.

### Modern Development Features
While programmers enjoy IntelliSense, refactoring, and find-usages, logic practitioners work with static text.

### Community and Sharing
No equivalent to GitHub or npm for logic systems. Each textbook, course, and research project rebuilds from scratch.

### Domain Flexibility
Tools are built for specific logic systems. A medical researcher can't easily create diagnostic reasoning rules, nor can a lawyer formalize legal arguments.

## The Result

- **Students** struggle to learn formal logic
- **Researchers** waste time on mechanical tasks
- **Professionals** avoid formal methods
- **Domains** remain disconnected from logical reasoning tools
