# Problem Space Analysis

## Overview

This section examines the current state of formal logic tools, their limitations, and the technical feasibility of addressing these constraints.

## Contents

### [Current State](current-state.md)
Analysis of existing approaches to formal logic tools and their characteristics.

### [Current Limitations](current-limitations.md)
Systematic examination of constraints in current tools across multiple dimensions.

### [Technical Feasibility](technical-feasibility.md)
Analysis of technical approaches that could address identified limitations.

## Key Findings

Current formal logic tools exhibit significant constraints in:
- Representation methods (primarily text-based)
- Operational workflows (fragmented and manual)
- Distribution mechanisms (limited sharing)
- Extensibility (fixed logical systems)

Technical precedents from software development tools suggest these constraints can be addressed through established techniques.
