# Problem Space Analysis

## Overview

This section examines the current state of formal logic tools, their limitations, and the technical feasibility of addressing these constraints.

## Contents

### [Current State](current-state.md)
Analysis of existing approaches to formal logic tools and their characteristics.

### [Current Limitations](current-limitations.md)
Systematic examination of constraints in current tools across multiple dimensions.

### [Technical Feasibility](technical-feasibility.md)
Analysis of technical approaches that could address identified limitations.

## Key Findings

Current formal logic tools exhibit significant constraints in:
- Platform accessibility (desktop-only paradigm)
- Representation methods (keyboard-centric, not touch-friendly)
- Operational workflows (fragmented across incompatible platforms)
- Distribution mechanisms (no universal sharing protocols)
- Extensibility (platform-specific implementations)
- Mobility (no support for learning or working on-the-go)

Technical precedents from modern multi-platform applications demonstrate these constraints can be overcome through responsive design and platform abstraction.
