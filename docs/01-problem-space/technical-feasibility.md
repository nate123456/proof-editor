# Technical Feasibility

## Precedent in Software Development Tools

Software development tools evolved from text editors to integrated development environments through the addition of:

### Static Analysis
- Syntax checking during editing
- Type inference and checking
- Dependency analysis
- Error detection before execution

### Structural Manipulation
- Automated refactoring operations
- Symbol renaming across scopes
- Code navigation by structure
- Pattern-based transformations

### Integration
- Unified tool chains
- Shared data models
- Consistent interfaces
- Automated workflows

## Applicability to Formal Logic

### Structural Properties
Formal logic exhibits properties amenable to tooling:
- Well-defined syntax rules
- Explicit inference patterns
- Compositional structure
- Verifiable correctness criteria

### Existing Techniques
Proven techniques from software tools apply directly:
- Parser construction for logical notation
- Graph algorithms for dependency tracking
- Pattern matching for inference rules
- Incremental computation for real-time feedback

### Modular Architecture
Logic systems can be decomposed into:
- Syntax definitions
- Inference rules
- Validation procedures
- Notation conventions

## Technical Components
