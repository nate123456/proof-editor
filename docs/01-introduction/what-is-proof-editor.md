# What is Proof Editor?

*A visual tool for constructing logical reasoning through statement flow between processing units*

## For People Who Think Logically

If you're a philosopher, mathematician, logician, or student working with formal reasoning, Proof Editor is designed for you. The platform's three-tier SDK accommodates different technical comfort levels: most users can accomplish their goals through YAML configuration alone (Tier 1), while advanced users can write JavaScript validation rules (Tier 2) or full LSP extensions (Tier 3). Your domain expertise is the valuable skill; the platform provides the technical framework.

## What Does It Do?

### Visual Statement Processing
Instead of writing proofs as walls of text, Proof Editor lets you build them as physical systems where statements flow between processing units. You create statement processing units, connect them so statements can flow between them, and watch your reasoning emerge as a working system.

**Think of it like this**: Traditional proofs are like reading a recipe. Proof Editor is like building a working kitchen where ingredients (statements) flow between stations (processing units) to create the final dish (conclusions).

### Example: A Simple Argument

**Traditional text proof:**
```
1. All men are mortal        (Premise)
2. Socrates is a man         (Premise)  
3. Therefore, Socrates is mortal  (Conclusion from 1,2)
```

**In Proof Editor:**
- You see statements flowing between processing units
- When you change "All men are mortal," it flows to every processing unit that uses it
- You can trace how statements move through your reasoning system
- Complex arguments become manageable through physical organization

## Why Use Visual Proofs?

### See the Physical System
- Understand your entire statement processing network at once
- Identify where statement flow breaks down immediately  
- Navigate complex reasoning systems without getting lost
- Present your work as a functioning system to others

### Build Processing Networks
- Start with simple processing units and connect them gradually
- Create statement flow channels between processing units
- Reuse statements across multiple processing units
- Collaborate with others on the same reasoning system

### Learn and Teach Effectively
- Students can see how logical reasoning works
- Instructors can demonstrate proof techniques visually
- Mistakes become visible learning opportunities
- Success feels tangible and rewarding

## Who Uses Proof Editor?

### Philosophy Professors
*"I use clear documentation and examples to create custom logical systems for my students."*
- Create custom logical systems using simple YAML configuration
- Build on provided templates and examples for common philosophical frameworks
- Demonstrate proof techniques with systems tailored to your theoretical needs

### Mathematics Researchers  
*"I can implement complex logical relationships using the platform's extensible framework."*
- Use the 3-tier SDK to model mathematical reasoning patterns
- Build novel mathematical structures through configuration and scripting
- Focus on mathematical insight while leveraging platform capabilities

### Logic Students
*"When I make mistakes, the system shows me what went wrong with clear feedback."*
- Learn formal reasoning through interactive proof construction
- Get immediate validation feedback on logical errors
- Build understanding through structured practice with custom logic systems

### Applied Logicians
*"I can formalize domain-specific reasoning using the extensible platform."*
- Legal professionals: Create logic systems for modeling contract obligations
- Medical professionals: Build diagnostic reasoning that handles uncertainty
- Business analysts: Formalize decision trees with risk assessment logic

## How Is This Different from Other Tools?

### Not Just for Experts
Most formal reasoning tools assume you're already an expert. Proof Editor helps you become one. It's designed for learning and discovery, not just verification.

### Visual and Interactive
Traditional tools focus on symbolic manipulation. Proof Editor focuses on understanding. You see your reasoning, not just symbols.

### Flexible and Customizable
You're not locked into one type of logic. Create systems that match how you actually think and reason in your field.

### Works Everywhere
Use it on your laptop for detailed work, on your tablet for presentations, or on your phone for quick idea capture. Your work syncs across all your devices.

## What Makes a Good Proof Editor User?

### You Think Systematically
- You like to understand how conclusions follow from premises
- You appreciate clear, logical reasoning
- You want to construct valid arguments

### You Value Clarity
- You prefer understanding over memorization
- You like to see patterns and relationships
- You want to communicate your reasoning to others

### You Use Clear Documentation
- You bring domain expertise, the platform provides technical framework
- Follow documented patterns: Tier 1 (YAML config), Tier 2 (JavaScript rules), Tier 3 (LSP programming)
- Focus on logical accuracy first, then choose the appropriate technical tier
- Most users achieve their goals through Tier 1 configuration, with programming required only for advanced customization

## Getting Started

The best way to understand Proof Editor is to build your first proof. It takes about 10 minutes to go from "What is this?" to "I built something that works!"

## Questions People Ask

### "Is this just for academics?"
No. Anyone who needs to construct logical arguments can benefit. Lawyers building legal cases, doctors working through diagnoses, business analysts creating decision trees - logical reasoning happens everywhere.

### "Do I need to know programming?"
For most use cases, no. The platform's three-tier approach means 90% of users can accomplish their goals through YAML configuration alone (Tier 1). Advanced users who need custom validation logic will use JavaScript (Tier 2), while those creating complete reasoning environments require full LSP programming (Tier 3). The documentation provides clear templates and examples for each tier.

### "Can I create my own logical systems?"
Yes, through the platform's three-tier SDK. Tier 1 uses YAML configuration for standard logical patterns - "I need a deontic logic where obligations can conflict and be prioritized." Tier 2 requires JavaScript programming for custom validation rules. Tier 3 involves full LSP development for complete reasoning environments. The documentation provides templates and examples for each tier, with most users finding success at Tier 1.

### "Will this replace traditional proof methods?"
Proof Editor complements traditional methods. You can export your visual proofs to traditional formats, or import traditional proofs to visualize them. Use whatever method works best for your situation.

### "Can I use this for teaching?"
Absolutely. Many instructors find that visual proofs help students understand logical reasoning more quickly and retain it longer. The tool includes features specifically designed for educational use.

## The Big Picture

Proof Editor isn't trying to replace human reasoning - it's trying to enhance it. The goal is to help you think more clearly, reason more systematically, and communicate your ideas more effectively.

Whether you're a student learning your first logical system, a researcher developing new theoretical frameworks, or a professional applying logical reasoning to real-world problems, Proof Editor adapts to support your thinking.
