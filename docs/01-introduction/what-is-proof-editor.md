# What is Proof Editor?

*A visual tool for constructing and sharing logical arguments*

## For People Who Think Logically

If you're a philosopher, mathematician, logician, or student working with formal reasoning, Proof Editor is designed for you. You don't need to be a programmer - the platform provides clear documentation and examples that enable you to implement your logical ideas through simple configuration. Your domain expertise is the valuable skill; the platform provides the technical framework.

## What Does It Do?

### Visual Proof Construction
Instead of writing proofs as walls of text, Proof Editor lets you build them visually. You can see the logical flow, understand the structure at a glance, and spot mistakes before they become problems.

**Think of it like this**: Traditional proofs are like reading sheet music. Proof Editor is like actually hearing the music played. Both contain the same information, but one is immediately comprehensible.

### Example: A Simple Argument

**Traditional text proof:**
```
1. All men are mortal        (Premise)
2. Socrates is a man         (Premise)  
3. Therefore, Socrates is mortal  (Conclusion from 1,2)
```

**In Proof Editor:**
- You see the logical connection visually
- When you change "All men are mortal," it automatically updates everywhere that statement is used
- You can follow the reasoning path with your eyes
- Complex arguments become manageable through visual organization

## Why Use Visual Proofs?

### See the Big Picture
- Understand your entire argument structure at once
- Identify weak points and missing steps immediately  
- Navigate complex reasoning without getting lost
- Present your work clearly to others

### Build Systematically
- Start with simple steps and build complexity gradually
- Connect ideas by drawing logical relationships
- Reuse common reasoning patterns
- Collaborate with others on the same proof

### Learn and Teach Effectively
- Students can see how logical reasoning works
- Instructors can demonstrate proof techniques visually
- Mistakes become visible learning opportunities
- Success feels tangible and rewarding

## Who Uses Proof Editor?

### Philosophy Professors
*"I use clear documentation and examples to create custom logical systems for my students."*
- Create custom logical systems using simple YAML configuration
- Build on provided templates and examples for common philosophical frameworks
- Demonstrate proof techniques with systems tailored to your theoretical needs

### Mathematics Researchers  
*"I can implement complex logical relationships using the platform's extensible framework."*
- Use the 3-tier SDK to model mathematical reasoning patterns
- Build novel mathematical structures through configuration and scripting
- Focus on mathematical insight while leveraging platform capabilities

### Logic Students
*"When I make mistakes, the system shows me what went wrong with clear feedback."*
- Learn formal reasoning through interactive proof construction
- Get immediate validation feedback on logical errors
- Build understanding through structured practice with custom logic systems

### Applied Logicians
*"I can formalize domain-specific reasoning using the extensible platform."*
- Legal professionals: Create logic systems for modeling contract obligations
- Medical professionals: Build diagnostic reasoning that handles uncertainty
- Business analysts: Formalize decision trees with risk assessment logic

## How Is This Different from Other Tools?

### Not Just for Experts
Most formal reasoning tools assume you're already an expert. Proof Editor helps you become one. It's designed for learning and discovery, not just verification.

### Visual and Interactive
Traditional tools focus on symbolic manipulation. Proof Editor focuses on understanding. You see your reasoning, not just symbols.

### Flexible and Customizable
You're not locked into one type of logic. Create systems that match how you actually think and reason in your field.

### Works Everywhere
Use it on your laptop for detailed work, on your tablet for presentations, or on your phone for quick idea capture. Your work syncs across all your devices.

## What Makes a Good Proof Editor User?

### You Think Systematically
- You like to understand how conclusions follow from premises
- You appreciate clear, logical reasoning
- You want to construct valid arguments

### You Value Clarity
- You prefer understanding over memorization
- You like to see patterns and relationships
- You want to communicate your reasoning to others

### You Use Clear Documentation
- You bring domain expertise, the platform provides technical framework
- Follow documented patterns and examples to implement your logical systems
- Focus on logical accuracy and philosophical soundness, not programming details
- Iterate using the platform's configuration system until it matches your logical vision

## Getting Started

The best way to understand Proof Editor is to build your first proof. It takes about 10 minutes to go from "What is this?" to "I built something that works!"

## Questions People Ask

### "Is this just for academics?"
No. Anyone who needs to construct logical arguments can benefit. Lawyers building legal cases, doctors working through diagnoses, business analysts creating decision trees - logical reasoning happens everywhere.

### "Do I need to know programming?"
Absolutely not. The platform provides clear documentation, templates, and examples for implementing logical systems. Use simple YAML configuration for most cases: "I need a modal logic system that handles temporal operators." Follow the documented patterns while you validate the logical accuracy.

### "Can I create my own logical systems?"
Yes, through the platform's configuration system. Use the documented templates for logical concepts: "I need a deontic logic where obligations can conflict and be prioritized." The platform's 3-tier SDK (YAML config, JavaScript rules, full LSP) provides the technical framework while you ensure it captures your logical intent. Most users can accomplish their goals with YAML configuration alone.

### "Will this replace traditional proof methods?"
Proof Editor complements traditional methods. You can export your visual proofs to traditional formats, or import traditional proofs to visualize them. Use whatever method works best for your situation.

### "Can I use this for teaching?"
Absolutely. Many instructors find that visual proofs help students understand logical reasoning more quickly and retain it longer. The tool includes features specifically designed for educational use.

## The Big Picture

Proof Editor isn't trying to replace human reasoning - it's trying to enhance it. The goal is to help you think more clearly, reason more systematically, and communicate your ideas more effectively.

Whether you're a student learning your first logical system, a researcher developing new theoretical frameworks, or a professional applying logical reasoning to real-world problems, Proof Editor adapts to support your thinking.
