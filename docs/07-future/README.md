# Future Considerations

## Overview

This section examines potential technical and research directions for formal reasoning tools. These represent areas of investigation rather than committed development plans.

## Research Areas

### [AI Integration](ai-integration.md)
Intersection of machine learning techniques with formal reasoning systems.

### [Educational Applications](education.md)
Pedagogical implications and opportunities in formal logic education.

### [Research Methodologies](research.md)
Impact on research practices across disciplines using formal methods.

## Technical Trajectories

Areas warranting investigation include:
- Integration of automated reasoning techniques
- Scalability to large proof repositories
- Cross-domain reasoning frameworks
- Collaborative proof construction protocols
- Formal verification of the platform itself

## Open Questions

Significant unknowns requiring research:
- Optimal visual representations for different proof types
- Balancing automation with user understanding
- Managing complexity in large formal systems
- Ensuring correctness while enabling flexibility
- Supporting emerging logical frameworks
