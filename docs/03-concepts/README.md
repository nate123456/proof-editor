# Core Concepts

## The Building Blocks of Proof Editor

These fundamental concepts form the foundation of how Proof Editor represents and manipulates logical reasoning. Understanding these concepts is essential for grasping the platform's approach.

## In This Section

### [Atomic Arguments](atomic-arguments.md)
The fundamental unit of reasoning - a single logical step.

### [Connections](connections.md)
How atomic arguments link together to form chains of reasoning.

### [Trees](trees.md)
Collections of connected atomic arguments forming complete proofs.

### [Documents](documents.md)
The canvas where proof trees live and interact.

### [Language Layer](language-layer.md)
The customizable system that separates logical structure from presentation.

## Design Philosophy

These concepts aren't arbitrary - they emerge from how humans naturally think about logical reasoning. By aligning our tool with mental models, we create an intuitive yet powerful system.
