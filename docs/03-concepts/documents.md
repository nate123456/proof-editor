# Documents

See [Key Terms](./key-terms.md#document) for the definition.

## What Documents Do

Documents are workspaces where you:
- Create atomic arguments and connect them into trees
- Position entire argument trees on the canvas
- Save and share your logical work

Think of them as infinite canvases for proof construction.

## Key Features

### Infinite Canvas
- **Pan**: Click and drag to navigate
- **Zoom**: Scroll or pinch to zoom in/out
- **Auto-fit**: Double-click background to fit all content
- **Mini-map**: Overview panel for large proofs

### Organization
- **Tree positioning**: Place entire argument trees anywhere on the canvas
- **Multiple trees**: Work with multiple separate proofs in one space
- **Tree-based selection**: Select and move complete argument trees
- **Layout styles**: Choose how each tree displays (top-down, radial, etc.)

### Document Types
- **Working documents**: Editable spaces for active proof development
- **Presentation documents**: Read-only views optimized for sharing
- **Templates**: Pre-structured documents for common proof patterns

### Persistence & Sharing
- **Auto-save**: Changes saved continuously
- **Version history**: Track and revert changes
- **Export**: PDF, image, or interactive formats
- **Collaboration**: Real-time multi-user editing

Documents separate logical structure (the connections) from tree positioning (where each tree is anchored). Individual atomic arguments get their positions computed from tree structure.
