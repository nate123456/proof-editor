# Documents

See [Key Terms](./key-terms.md#document) for the definition.

## What Documents Do

Documents are workspaces where you:
- Create and position atomic arguments
- Connect them to form proofs
- Save and share your logical work

Think of them as infinite canvases for proof construction.

## Key Features

### Infinite Canvas
- **Pan**: Click and drag to navigate
- **Zoom**: Scroll or pinch to zoom in/out
- **Auto-fit**: Double-click background to fit all content
- **Mini-map**: Overview panel for large proofs

### Organization
- **Spatial layout**: Place atomic arguments anywhere
- **Multiple trees**: Work with related proofs in one space
- **Grouping**: Select and group related arguments
- **Layers**: Show/hide different parts of complex proofs

### Document Types
- **Working documents**: Editable spaces for active proof development
- **Presentation documents**: Read-only views optimized for sharing
- **Templates**: Pre-structured documents for common proof patterns

### Persistence & Sharing
- **Auto-save**: Changes saved continuously
- **Version history**: Track and revert changes
- **Export**: PDF, image, or interactive formats
- **Collaboration**: Real-time multi-user editing

Documents separate logical structure (the connections) from visual layout (where things appear on screen).
