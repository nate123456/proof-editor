# Documents

## Definition

A document is the canvas where argument trees exist. It provides spatial organization, persistent storage, and contextual grouping for related proofs and logical work.

## Document as Workspace

### Infinite Canvas
- No artificial boundaries
- Zoom and pan freely
- Place atomic arguments and argument trees anywhere
- Natural spatial organization

### Multiple Trees
- Related proofs in one place
- Independent theorem development
- Visual separation of concerns
- Cross-tree connections possible

## Document Properties

### Metadata
- Title and description
- Author information
- Creation/modification dates
- Tags and categories
- Version information

### Organization
- Visual layout preserved
- Logical grouping of trees
- Annotation areas
- Reference sections

## Interaction Model

### Spatial Navigation
- Minimap overview
- Zoom to specific areas
- Bookmark important locations
- Smart camera controls

### Content Management
- Add new atomic arguments anywhere
- Move trees as units
- Group related content
- Layer management

## Document Types

### Working Documents
- Active proof development
- Messy, exploratory
- Multiple attempts visible
- Thinking made visible

### Presentation Documents
- Cleaned up for sharing
- Clear narrative flow
- Hidden complexity
- Publication ready

### Template Documents
- Reusable proof patterns
- Domain-specific starters
- Educational scaffolds
- Best practices

## Collaboration Features

### Shared Workspace
- Multiple users simultaneously
- See others' cursors
- Real-time updates
- Conflict resolution

### Permissions
- View-only access
- Comment and annotate
- Edit specific trees
- Full collaboration

## Document Lifecycle

### Creation
- Start from blank canvas
- Use templates
- Import existing proofs
- Fork from others

### Development
- Iterative refinement
- Save checkpoints
- Branch explorations
- Track changes

### Sharing

- Embed in publications

## Advanced Features

### Cross-References
- Link between documents
- Import trees from others
- Build document libraries
- Create proof wikis

### Annotations
- Freeform notes
- Callouts and explanations
- Visual markers
- Teaching annotations

### Automation
- Auto-layout options
- Style applications
- Batch operations
- Smart organization

## Document Philosophy

### Thinking Space
Documents aren't just containers - they're thinking spaces where ideas develop, connect, and mature.

### Persistent Context
Unlike ephemeral whiteboards, documents preserve not just the final proof but the journey of discovery.

### Social Objects
Documents become objects of collaboration, teaching, and knowledge sharing in the community.
