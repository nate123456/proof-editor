# Language Layer

## Separation of Structure and Presentation

Proof Editor maintains a strict separation between the abstract logical structures (atomic arguments, connections, trees) and how they are presented to users. This separation is achieved through the language layer - a customizable system that defines how logical content is parsed, displayed, and interacted with.

## Core Architecture

### Abstract Layer
The abstract layer defines what logical structures **are**:
- Atomic arguments: Relations between two ordered n-tuples of strings
- Connections: Relationships where conclusions become premises
- Argument trees: Complete sets of connected atomic arguments
- Documents: Collections of argument trees

### Language Layer
The language layer defines how these structures are **interpreted and displayed**:
- Syntax rules for parsing strings in tuples
- Display formatting for premises and conclusions
- Visual representation choices
- Notation systems and symbols
- Interaction patterns

### Visualization Layer
The visualization layer renders the interpreted structures:
- Spatial layouts (2D, 3D, VR, etc.)
- Visual metaphors (lines, boxes, nodes, etc.)
- Animation and transitions
- User interaction handling

## Language Layer Responsibilities

### Parsing and Interpretation
- Define how strings in tuples are parsed
- Specify operator precedence and associativity
- Handle domain-specific notation
- Support unicode and special symbols

### Display Rules
- How tuples are formatted (not necessarily with commas)
- How the implication relation is shown (not necessarily as a horizontal line)
- Text direction and layout
- Symbol rendering

### Validation Rules
- Syntax checking for the domain
- Semantic validation rules
- Type systems (if applicable)
- Custom constraint checking

## Examples of Different Language Layers

### Mathematical Logic
- Operators: ∧, ∨, →, ¬, ∀, ∃
- Tuple separator: comma
- Implication display: horizontal line
- Precedence: standard mathematical

### Legal Reasoning
- Operators: "therefore", "whereas", "given that"
- Tuple separator: semicolon or newline
- Implication display: box with arrow
- Precedence: natural language

### Programming Proofs
- Operators: &&, ||, =>, !
- Tuple separator: newline
- Implication display: indented blocks
- Precedence: programming language specific

### Visual Logic
- Operators: graphical symbols
- Tuple separator: spatial arrangement
- Implication display: containment or color
- Precedence: visual hierarchy

## Implementation Considerations

### Pluggable Architecture
Language layers are modular components that can be swapped out or customized. Each language layer defines:
- How to interpret the strings in atomic arguments
- How to display those strings to users  
- What validation rules apply
- What symbols and operators are available

### User Control
Users can:
- Select from predefined language layers
- Customize existing layers
- Create entirely new layers
- Switch between layers for the same proof

### Preservation of Meaning
When switching language layers:
- The abstract structure remains unchanged
- Only the presentation changes
- Semantic meaning is preserved
- Proofs remain valid

## Benefits of Separation

### Flexibility
- Support any domain's notation
- Accommodate different cultural conventions
- Enable accessibility features
- Allow personal preferences

### Portability
- Share proofs across different systems
- Export to various formats
- Import from different sources
- Maintain compatibility

### Evolution
- Add new notations without changing core
- Experiment with novel representations
- Adapt to emerging standards
- Support legacy formats

## Design Philosophy

The language layer embodies a key design choice: **separate logical structure from its representation**. By decoupling proof data from display format, Proof Editor becomes an adaptable tool for formal reasoning that can be customized for different domains, notations, and preferences.
