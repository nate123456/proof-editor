# Language Layer

See [Key Terms](./key-terms.md#language-layer) for the definition.

## [LSP] Language Server Protocol Foundation

Language layers are implemented as Language Server Protocol (LSP) servers that provide intelligent analysis and validation for specific logical systems. Each language layer:
- Parses statement strings within ordered sets
- Validates logical inferences according to domain rules
- Provides real-time diagnostics and suggestions
- Enables code completion and hover information

## [LSP] Protocol Capabilities

Language servers provide these capabilities through standard LSP methods:

| LSP Feature | Proof-Specific Application |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| `textDocument/didChange` | Validates statements as typed |
| `textDocument/diagnostic` | Reports invalid inferences |
| `textDocument/completion` | Suggests logical operators |
| `textDocument/hover` | Explains rules and symbols |
| `proof/validateArgument` | Custom validation for atomic arguments |
| `proof/completeInference` | AI-assisted conclusion generation |

## [LSP] Transport Mechanisms

Language servers communicate via transport-agnostic protocols:
- **stdio**: Process-based communication for desktop
- **WebSocket**: Network communication for mobile/web
- **HTTP**: Stateless validation services
- **TCP**: Direct socket connections

## Example Language Implementations

### Mathematical Logic Server
- **Operators**: ∧, ∨, →, ¬, ∀, ∃
- **Validation**: Well-formed formula checking via LSP diagnostics
- **Completion**: Context-aware operator suggestions
- **Analysis**: Quantifier scope validation

### Natural Language Server
- **Keywords**: "therefore", "because", "given"
- **Validation**: Grammar and coherence checking
- **Completion**: Phrase and connector suggestions
- **Analysis**: Argument structure verification

### Programming Logic Server
- **Operators**: &&, ||, =>, !
- **Validation**: Type checking and consistency
- **Completion**: Variable and predicate suggestions
- **Analysis**: Control flow verification

## [LSP] Key Protocol Benefits

- **Language agnostic**: Platform doesn't understand logic, LSP servers do
- **Hot-swappable**: Change languages without closing documents
- **Extensible**: Add new validation rules via server updates
- **Performance**: Async validation doesn't block editing

Language servers make Proof Editor adaptable to any text-based formal reasoning system while maintaining consistent protocol communication.
