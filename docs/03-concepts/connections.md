# Connections

## Definition

Connections represent the logical flow between atomic arguments. Two atomic arguments are directly connected when a conclusion of one atomic argument functions as a premise in the other. Atomic arguments are connected when there is a path of directly connected atomic arguments between them.

## Types of Connections

### Direct Connection
Atomic arguments are directly connected when a conclusion of one atomic argument functions as a premise in the other. This forms the basic link in chains of logical reasoning.

*Example visualization (using one possible notation and layout):*
```
Atomic Argument 1:    P, P → Q        Atomic Argument 2:    Q, Q → R
                      ─────────                           ─────────
                          Q ─────────connection────────→ R
```

In this example, the conclusion "Q" from Atomic Argument 1 is used as a premise in Atomic Argument 2, creating a direct connection.

### Connected Arguments
Atomic arguments are connected when there is a path of directly connected atomic arguments between them. This transitive relationship allows for complex proof structures.

### Shared Statement
Multiple atomic arguments may use the same conclusion as their premise.

*Example of shared statements:*
```
                           ┌→ Atomic Argument 2 (uses Q)
Atomic Argument 1 (produces Q)
                           └→ Atomic Argument 3 (uses Q)
```

This shows how one conclusion can serve as a premise for multiple atomic arguments. The actual visual representation depends on the chosen visualization system.

## Visualization Options

*Note: How connections are displayed depends entirely on the visualization layer. Here are some possibilities that a visualization system might implement:*

### Possible Visual Representations
- Lines or arrows between atomic arguments
- Color coding to show relationships
- Proximity-based grouping
- Animation to show logical flow
- Highlighting for emphasis
- Alternative representations (e.g., containment, layering, 3D relationships)

### Interaction Possibilities
- Direct manipulation of connections
- Visual feedback during editing
- Multiple viewing modes
- Filtering and focusing options

## Connection Rules

### Valid Connections
- Exact string matching (initially)
- Type compatibility (in typed systems)
- No circular dependencies
- Maintains logical dependency order

### Invalid Connections
- Cannot connect premise to premise
- Cannot connect conclusion to conclusion
- Cannot create circular reasoning
- Must respect atomic argument dependencies

## Connection Management

### Establishing Connections
Connections are established when:
- A string in one atomic argument's conclusion tuple matches a string in another's premise tuple
- The system recognizes semantic equivalence (based on the language layer's rules)
- Users explicitly create connections between compatible statements

### Connection Operations
- Create new connections
- Remove existing connections
- Query connection relationships
- Validate connection consistency

## Semantic Importance

### Proof Flow
Connections define how logic flows through a proof. They transform isolated atomic arguments into coherent reasoning.

### Dependency Tracking
By following connections, we can:
- Identify what depends on what
- Find all uses of a statement
- Trace reasoning paths
- Detect missing links

### Validation Foundation
Connections enable:
- Checking logical consistency
- Identifying unsupported claims
- Verifying complete proofs
- Finding shortest proof paths

## Advanced Features

### Connection Metadata
- Strength or confidence levels
- Alternative connection types
- Temporal ordering
- Domain-specific properties

### Smart Connections
- Auto-suggest likely connections
- Pattern-based matching
- Fuzzy matching for variants
- Connection inference

### Layout Independence
- Connections exist independently of visual layout
- Multiple visualization strategies possible
- Layout algorithms can optimize for different goals
- Semantic structure preserved regardless of visual presentation
