# Proof Editor Documentation

## Overview

This documentation presents the conceptual design for Proof Editor - a focused two-platform tool that empowers domain experts to create and share custom logical reasoning systems through comprehensive documentation and examples. Philosophy professors, logicians, and students use clear templates and configuration to implement their logical ideas without needing programming skills. The architecture emphasizes 90%+ code reuse across VS Code Extension and React Native App through a clean platform abstraction design.

## Project Phase

The project is in the conceptual design phase, establishing:
- Problem definition and constraints
- Two-platform architecture (VS Code Extension + React Native App)
- User needs and workflows across desktop and mobile devices
- Platform-agnostic system requirements with focused abstraction layer
- Technical feasibility for 90%+ code reuse between platforms

## Documentation Scope

This documentation addresses conceptual design only. Technical implementation details will be documented in [technical-planning/](../technical-planning/README.md) when the project enters development phase.

## Key Insights

### The Documentation-Driven Revolution

Traditional formal logic tools assume users must learn programming to create custom systems. With comprehensive documentation and templates, this barrier disappears:
- **Domain experts use clear templates** → Platform provides working implementations
- **Students get stuck on errors** → Clear validation feedback explains problems and suggests fixes  
- **Researchers explore novel ideas** → Extensible platform helps model and test theoretical frameworks
- **Applied professionals need custom logic** → Template system enables domain-specific reasoning systems

This transforms accessibility from "accommodating different skill levels" to "amplifying domain expertise through comprehensive documentation and examples," leading to a fundamental shift in how logic is taught, learned, and applied in research, and enabling expert-driven knowledge creation.

### Platform Independence for Expert Workflows

Documentation-driven workflows must work identically across all platforms:
- Desktop: Full-featured template and configuration system with VS Code integration
- Mobile: Touch-optimized documentation access with offline capabilities  
- Web: Browser-based example library with progressive enhancement
- Collaboration: Shared template and package system across distributed teams

### Design Philosophy

The core concepts align with how humans naturally think about logical reasoning, creating an intuitive yet powerful system. Each capability reinforces the others:
- Visual proofs benefit from IDE intelligence
- IDE features work across all platforms
- Validation provides immediate visual feedback
- Accessibility ensures everyone can use every feature

### Ecosystem Architecture

The ecosystem enables:
- Definition of custom logical systems through declarative specifications
- User-managed distribution of logic packages via GitHub
- Version control and dependency management
- Collaborative development of proofs and systems
- Cross-domain knowledge sharing

Built on principles of modular system composition, version compatibility management, distributed development model, user-controlled quality assurance, and preservation of formal correctness.

### Technical Approach

The technical specifications:
- Define concrete data structures with types
- Address performance and scalability concerns
- Specify algorithms and operations
- Consider edge cases and error conditions
- Provide clear implementation guidance

Each technical design document maps directly to concepts defined in the Core Concepts section, providing the engineering details needed for implementation.
