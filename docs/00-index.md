# Proof Editor Documentation

## Overview

This documentation presents the conceptual design for Proof Editor - a focused two-platform tool that empowers domain experts to create and share custom logical reasoning systems through AI collaboration. Philosophy professors, logicians, and students partner with AI to implement their logical ideas without needing programming skills. The architecture emphasizes 90%+ code reuse across VS Code Extension and React Native App through a clean platform abstraction design.

## Project Phase

The project is in the conceptual design phase, establishing:
- Problem definition and constraints
- Two-platform architecture (VS Code Extension + React Native App)
- User needs and workflows across desktop and mobile devices
- Platform-agnostic system requirements with focused abstraction layer
- Technical feasibility for 90%+ code reuse between platforms

## Documentation Scope

This documentation addresses conceptual design only. Technical implementation details will be documented in [technical-planning/](../technical-planning/README.md) when the project enters development phase.

## Key Insights

### The AI-Augmented Revolution

Traditional formal logic tools assume users must learn programming to create custom systems. With AI assistance, this barrier disappears:
- **Domain experts describe concepts** → AI generates working implementations
- **Students get stuck on errors** → AI explains problems and suggests fixes  
- **Researchers explore novel ideas** → AI helps model and test theoretical frameworks
- **Applied professionals need custom logic** → AI creates domain-specific reasoning systems

This transforms accessibility from "accommodating different skill levels" to "amplifying domain expertise through AI partnership."

### Platform Independence for AI Collaboration

AI-augmented workflows must work identically across all platforms:
- Desktop: Full-featured AI collaboration with VS Code integration
- Mobile: Touch-optimized AI assistance with offline capabilities  
- Web: Browser-based AI partnership with progressive enhancement
- Collaboration: AI as shared reasoning partner across distributed teams

### Design Philosophy

The core concepts align with how humans naturally think about logical reasoning, creating an intuitive yet powerful system. Each capability reinforces the others:
- Visual proofs benefit from IDE intelligence
- IDE features work across all platforms
- Validation provides immediate visual feedback
- Accessibility ensures everyone can use every feature

### Ecosystem Architecture

The ecosystem enables:
- Definition of custom logical systems through declarative specifications
- User-managed distribution of logic packages via GitHub
- Version control and dependency management
- Collaborative development of proofs and systems
- Cross-domain knowledge sharing

Built on principles of modular system composition, version compatibility management, distributed development model, user-controlled quality assurance, and preservation of formal correctness.

### Technical Approach

The technical specifications:
- Define concrete data structures with types
- Address performance and scalability concerns
- Specify algorithms and operations
- Consider edge cases and error conditions
- Provide clear implementation guidance

Each technical design document maps directly to concepts defined in the Core Concepts section, providing the engineering details needed for implementation.
