# Proof Editor Documentation

## Overview

This documentation presents the conceptual design for Proof Editor - a multi-platform tool for constructing and analyzing formal logical arguments. The architecture emphasizes 90%+ code reuse across desktop (VS Code), mobile (iOS/Android), and web platforms through a clean three-layer design.

## Project Phase

The project is in the conceptual design phase, establishing:
- Problem definition and constraints
- Multi-platform architecture (CORE/LSP/PLATFORM layers)
- User needs and workflows across devices
- Platform-agnostic system requirements
- Technical feasibility for 90%+ code reuse

## Documentation Scope

This documentation addresses conceptual design only. Technical implementation details will be documented in [technical-planning/](../technical-planning/README.md) when the project enters development phase.

## Key Insights

### Problem Space Findings

Current formal logic tools exhibit significant constraints in:
- Platform accessibility (desktop-only paradigm)
- Representation methods (keyboard-centric, not touch-friendly)
- Operational workflows (fragmented across incompatible platforms)
- Distribution mechanisms (no universal sharing protocols)
- Extensibility (platform-specific implementations)
- Mobility (no support for learning or working on-the-go)

Technical precedents from modern multi-platform applications demonstrate these constraints can be overcome through responsive design and platform abstraction.

### Design Philosophy

The core concepts align with how humans naturally think about logical reasoning, creating an intuitive yet powerful system. Each capability reinforces the others:
- Visual proofs benefit from IDE intelligence
- IDE features work across all platforms
- Validation provides immediate visual feedback
- Accessibility ensures everyone can use every feature

### Ecosystem Architecture

The ecosystem enables:
- Definition of custom logical systems through declarative specifications
- User-managed distribution of logic packages via GitHub
- Version control and dependency management
- Collaborative development of proofs and systems
- Cross-domain knowledge sharing

Built on principles of modular system composition, version compatibility management, distributed development model, user-controlled quality assurance, and preservation of formal correctness.

### Technical Approach

The technical specifications:
- Define concrete data structures with types
- Address performance and scalability concerns
- Specify algorithms and operations
- Consider edge cases and error conditions
- Provide clear implementation guidance

Each technical design document maps directly to concepts defined in the Core Concepts section, providing the engineering details needed for implementation.
