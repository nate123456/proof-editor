# Sharing and Package Registry

## The npm of Logic Systems

A centralized registry where users can publish, discover, and install logic systems, theorem libraries, and proof templates. This infrastructure transforms isolated work into shared community resources.

## Registry Concepts

### Packages
Self-contained units containing:
- Logic system definitions
- Theorem libraries
- Proof templates
- Documentation
- Examples

### Versioning
- Semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
- Breaking change management
- Dependency resolution
- Version history

### Namespacing
- User namespaces: @username/package
- Organization namespaces: @company/package
- Official packages: @standard/package
- Community: No prefix

## Publishing Flow

### Package Creation
1. Define logic system or theorems
2. Add documentation
3. Include examples
4. Specify metadata
5. Test locally

### Quality Checks
- Automated validation
- Documentation review
- Example verification
- License compliance
- Security scanning

### Publication
- Command-line tools
- Web interface
- API access
- Batch operations
- Update notifications
