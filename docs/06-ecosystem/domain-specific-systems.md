# Domain-Specific Logic Systems

## Domain Adaptation Requirements

Different fields of study and practice require specialized logical frameworks that accommodate their specific reasoning patterns, terminology, and validity criteria.

## Characteristics of Domain-Specific Systems

### Specialized Vocabulary
Each domain employs:
- Technical terminology with precise definitions
- Domain-specific operators and relations
- Specialized quantifiers and modalities
- Field-specific inference patterns
- Conventional notation systems

### Reasoning Patterns
Domains exhibit distinct:
- Inference rules specific to the field
- Validity criteria based on domain knowledge
- Temporal and modal considerations
- Uncertainty handling mechanisms
- Compositional structures

## Representative Domain Examples

#### Formal Elements
- Deontic operators (obligation, permission, prohibition)
- Temporal operators for statutory interpretation
- Precedent-based inference rules
- Hierarchical authority relations
- Defeasible reasoning mechanisms

#### Structural Requirements
