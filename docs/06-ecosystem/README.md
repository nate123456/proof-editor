# Logic System Ecosystem

## Overview

This section describes the infrastructure for creating, sharing, and extending logical systems through a distributed package-based architecture.

## Components

### [Custom Logic Systems](custom-logic.md)
Mechanisms for defining user-specific logical frameworks.

### [Package Sharing](packages.md)
GitHub-based package distribution for logic system sharing.

### [Collaboration Features](collaboration.md)
Tools and protocols for collaborative proof development.

### [Domain-Specific Systems](domain-specific-systems.md)
Specialized logical frameworks for different fields of application.

## Ecosystem Architecture

The ecosystem enables:
- Definition of custom logical systems through declarative specifications
- User-managed distribution of logic packages via GitHub
- Version control and dependency management
- Collaborative development of proofs and systems
- Cross-domain knowledge sharing

## Design Principles

- Modular system composition
- Version compatibility management
- Distributed development model
- User-controlled quality assurance
- Preservation of formal correctness
