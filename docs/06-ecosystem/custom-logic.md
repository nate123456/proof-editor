# Custom Logic Systems

## Define Your Own Reasoning Language

Proof Editor enables users to create, customize, and share their own logical systems. This transforms the platform from a fixed tool into a flexible framework that adapts to any domain's reasoning needs.

## Why Custom Logic?

### Domain Specificity
Every field has unique reasoning patterns:
- **Law**: Precedent and statutory interpretation
- **Medicine**: Diagnostic reasoning and treatment protocols
- **Business**: Decision trees and compliance rules
- **Philosophy**: Modal, temporal, and deontic logics

### Innovation Enablement
- Experiment with new logical systems
- Extend existing frameworks
- Create hybrid approaches
- Push boundaries of formal reasoning

## Core Concepts

### Logic Definition
Users specify:
- **Symbols**: Custom operators and notation
- **Rules**: Inference patterns and validity
- **Syntax**: How statements are formed
- **Semantics**: What statements mean

### Declarative Approach
Define logic through configuration, not code:
- Human-readable formats
- Visual rule builders
- Template systems
- Import/export capabilities

### Extensibility
Build on existing systems:
- Extend classical logic
- Combine multiple systems
- Override specific rules
- Add domain features

## Creating Custom Systems

### Starting Points
- **From scratch**: Define everything
- **From templates**: Modify existing systems
- **From examples**: Learn from patterns
- **From community**: Fork and adapt

### Definition Components
- **Operators**: AND, OR, IMPLIES, custom
- **Quantifiers**: Universal, existential, custom
- **Inference rules**: Modus ponens, custom patterns
- **Validation rules**: What makes proofs valid

### Progressive Complexity
- Start with simple extensions
- Add features incrementally
- Test with real examples
- Refine based on usage

## Practical Examples

### Legal Logic System
- Operators for "shall", "may", "must"
- Rules for statutory interpretation
- Precedent relationship tracking
- Jurisdiction-specific variations
