# Custom Logic Systems

## Configure Your Logic Through Clear Templates

Proof Editor enables domain experts to create custom logical systems through comprehensive documentation and configuration templates. You specify your logical concepts - "I need a deontic logic that handles conflicting obligations" - using clear YAML configuration and examples. This transforms logic system creation from a programming task into a configuration process.

## Why Configuration-Based Custom Logic?

### Democratized Logic Creation
Clear templates and documentation remove the programming barrier for domain experts:
- **Philosophy professors**: Use modal logic templates for epistemic states
- **Legal scholars**: Configure logic systems for modeling contract obligations and breaches
- **Medical researchers**: Implement diagnostic reasoning with uncertainty using provided patterns
- **Business analysts**: Build decision logic that handles risk assessment through configuration

### Rapid Innovation
- **Configure concepts** → Platform implements systems through templates
- **Test with examples** → Refine configurations based on validation
- **Iterate systematically** → "Actually, let's add temporal operators" via config updates
- **Share immediately** → Configuration-based systems become community resources

## Core Concepts

### Logic Definition
Users specify:
- **Symbols**: Custom operators and notation
- **Rules**: Inference patterns and validity
- **Syntax**: How statements are formed
- **Semantics**: What statements mean

### Declarative Approach
Define logic through configuration, not code:
- Human-readable formats
- Visual rule builders
- Template systems
- Import/export capabilities

### Extensibility
Build on existing systems:
- Extend classical logic
- Combine multiple systems
- Override specific rules
- Add domain features

### Security and User Consent
**Important**: Any custom logic systems that include JavaScript validation rules or executable code are subject to the platform's security consent requirements. When sharing such packages with others or installing packages containing executable code, users will be prompted to:
- Review the executable components
- Understand security constraints and sandboxing measures
- Provide explicit consent before installation

For comprehensive details on consent processes and security requirements, see [Language Package Security Policy](../policies/language-package-security-policy.md).

## Configuration-Based System Creation

### Clear Documentation Workflows

#### The Philosophy Professor
```
Professor: "I need a deontic logic system that distinguishes between 
prima facie obligations and actual obligations. Prima facie 
obligations can be overridden by stronger moral duties."

Using Documentation: Following the modal logic template, create YAML config:
- O_pf(p) for prima facie obligations  
- O_act(p) for actual obligations
- Conflict resolution rules based on documented patterns

[Professor implements complete system using platform documentation]

Professor: "Perfect! Now add temporal operators so we can model 
obligations that arise over time."

Using Templates: "Adding temporal operators T_F (future) and T_P (past) 
following the temporal logic extension examples..."
```

#### The Legal Scholar
```
Scholar: "Model legal reasoning where statutes create default rules 
that can be overridden by more specific statutes or precedents."

Using Documentation: "Following the defeasible logic templates:
- Defeasible inference rules for statutory defaults
- Precedent strength operators from documented examples
- Specificity orderings using provided conflict resolution patterns..."
```

### Documentation-Driven Starting Points
- **Natural description**: Document your logical needs clearly
- **Example-driven**: "Like modal logic, but for obligations" - follow adaptation guides
- **Template adaptation**: "Take S5 modal logic template and modify it for..." - use documented patterns
- **Community extension**: "Fork this system and add..." - follow extension documentation

### Definition Components
- **Operators**: AND, OR, IMPLIES, custom
- **Quantifiers**: Universal, existential, custom
- **Inference rules**: Modus ponens, custom patterns
- **Validation rules**: What makes proofs valid

### Progressive Complexity
- Start with simple extensions
- Add features incrementally
- Test with real examples
- Refine based on usage

## Configuration Examples

### Legal Logic System (Template-Based)
**User**: "Create a legal reasoning system for contract law"

**Template Implementation**:
- Custom operators: `Must(x)`, `May(x)`, `Prohibited(x)`
- Precedent relations: `Overrides(case1, case2)`
- Statutory hierarchy: `StatutoryRank(statute, level)`
- Conflict resolution: Template-based rules for competing obligations
- Jurisdiction handling: `AppliesIn(rule, jurisdiction)`

### Medical Diagnostic Logic (Pattern-Based)
**User**: "I need diagnostic reasoning that handles uncertainty and contraindications"

**Documentation-Guided Implementation**:
- Probabilistic operators: `Likely(symptom, disease, p)`
- Diagnostic rules: `IfSymptoms(s1, s2) ThenSuggest(disease, confidence)`
- Contraindication logic: `Contraindicated(treatment, condition)`
- Temporal progression: `LeadsTo(condition1, condition2, timeframe)`

### Business Decision Logic (Framework-Based)
**User**: "Model business decisions with risk assessment and compliance constraints"

**Template-Driven Implementation**:
- Decision operators: `RiskLevel(decision, level)`, `ComplianceCheck(action, regulation)`
- Policy inheritance: `InheritsFrom(subsidiary_policy, parent_policy)`
- Multi-criteria analysis: Framework templates for balancing competing factors

```
User: "The system is allowing contradictory obligations"

Community Expert: "Your deontic logic allows both O(p) and O(¬p). 
Should you add a consistency constraint, or do you want to model 
genuine moral dilemmas? Check the deontic logic documentation."

User: "Model genuine dilemmas, but flag them for special reasoning"

Expert: "Follow the documented pattern for DilemmaFlag(O(p), O(¬p)) 
and special resolution rules in the deontic logic templates..."
