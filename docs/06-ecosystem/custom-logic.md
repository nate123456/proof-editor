# AI-Augmented Custom Logic Systems

## Describe Your Logic, AI Implements It

Proof Editor enables domain experts to create custom logical systems through natural language collaboration with AI. You describe your logical concepts - "I need a deontic logic that handles conflicting obligations" - and AI generates the complete implementation. This transforms logic system creation from a programming task into a collaborative conversation.

## Why AI-Augmented Custom Logic?

### Democratized Logic Creation
AI removes the programming barrier for domain experts:
- **Philosophy professors**: "Claude, create a modal logic for epistemic states"
- **Legal scholars**: "I need a logic system for modeling contract obligations and breaches"
- **Medical researchers**: "Help me formalize diagnostic reasoning with uncertainty"
- **Business analysts**: "Create a decision logic that handles risk assessment"

### Rapid Innovation
- **Describe concepts** → AI implements systems
- **Test with examples** → AI refines implementations
- **Iterate naturally** → "Actually, let's add temporal operators"
- **Share immediately** → AI-generated systems become community resources

## Core Concepts

### Logic Definition
Users specify:
- **Symbols**: Custom operators and notation
- **Rules**: Inference patterns and validity
- **Syntax**: How statements are formed
- **Semantics**: What statements mean

### Declarative Approach
Define logic through configuration, not code:
- Human-readable formats
- Visual rule builders
- Template systems
- Import/export capabilities

### Extensibility
Build on existing systems:
- Extend classical logic
- Combine multiple systems
- Override specific rules
- Add domain features

## AI-Augmented System Creation

### Natural Language Workflows

#### The Philosophy Professor
```
User: "I need a deontic logic system that distinguishes between 
prima facie obligations and actual obligations. Prima facie 
obligations can be overridden by stronger moral duties."

AI: "I'll create a deontic logic with two obligation operators:
- O_pf(p) for prima facie obligations  
- O_act(p) for actual obligations

Plus rules for obligation conflict resolution. Let me implement this..."

[AI generates complete LSP system with validation rules]

User: "Perfect! Now add temporal operators so we can model 
obligations that arise over time."

AI: "Adding temporal operators T_F (future) and T_P (past)..."
```

#### The Legal Scholar
```
User: "Model legal reasoning where statutes create default rules 
that can be overridden by more specific statutes or precedents."

AI: "I'll create a legal logic with:
- Defeasible inference rules for statutory defaults
- Precedent strength operators
- Specificity orderings for conflict resolution..."
```

### AI-Assisted Starting Points
- **Natural description**: Explain your logical needs
- **Example-driven**: "Like modal logic, but for obligations"
- **Template adaptation**: "Take S5 modal logic and modify it for..."
- **Community extension**: "Fork this system and add..."

### Definition Components
- **Operators**: AND, OR, IMPLIES, custom
- **Quantifiers**: Universal, existential, custom
- **Inference rules**: Modus ponens, custom patterns
- **Validation rules**: What makes proofs valid

### Progressive Complexity
- Start with simple extensions
- Add features incrementally
- Test with real examples
- Refine based on usage

## AI-Generated Examples

### Legal Logic System (AI-Created)
**User**: "Create a legal reasoning system for contract law"

**AI Implementation**:
- Custom operators: `Must(x)`, `May(x)`, `Prohibited(x)`
- Precedent relations: `Overrides(case1, case2)`
- Statutory hierarchy: `StatutoryRank(statute, level)`
- Conflict resolution: AI-generated rules for competing obligations
- Jurisdiction handling: `AppliesIn(rule, jurisdiction)`

### Medical Diagnostic Logic (AI-Created)
**User**: "I need diagnostic reasoning that handles uncertainty and contraindications"

**AI Implementation**:
- Probabilistic operators: `Likely(symptom, disease, p)`
- Diagnostic rules: `IfSymptoms(s1, s2) ThenSuggest(disease, confidence)`
- Contraindication logic: `Contraindicated(treatment, condition)`
- Temporal progression: `LeadsTo(condition1, condition2, timeframe)`

### Business Decision Logic (AI-Created)
**User**: "Model business decisions with risk assessment and compliance constraints"

**AI Implementation**:
- Decision operators: `RiskLevel(decision, level)`, `ComplianceCheck(action, regulation)`
- Policy inheritance: `InheritsFrom(subsidiary_policy, parent_policy)`
- Multi-criteria analysis: AI-generated frameworks for balancing competing factors

#### Example Refinement Session
```
User: "The system is allowing contradictory obligations"

AI: "I see the issue. Your deontic logic allows both O(p) and O(¬p). 
Should I add a consistency constraint, or do you want to model 
genuine moral dilemmas?"

User: "Model genuine dilemmas, but flag them for special reasoning"

AI: "Adding DilemmaFlag(O(p), O(¬p)) and special resolution rules..."
