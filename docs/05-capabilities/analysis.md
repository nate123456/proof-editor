# Analysis

## Custom Script Processing for Argument Trees

**Status**: Future Capability - Requires Design

The analysis capability envisions allowing users to create, edit, and share custom scripts to process their argument trees. This would provide extensibility for diverse domains and evolving analytical needs.

**Note**: This capability requires significant technical design work including:
- Security model and sandboxing architecture
- Script language selection or design
- API design for tree manipulation
- Performance considerations for large proofs
- Integration with language layers

## Core Functionality

### Script Creation and Management
- Create custom analysis scripts for domain-specific needs
- Edit and refine scripts based on experience
- Share scripts within communities of practice
- Import scripts from established libraries

### Basic Use Cases

#### Validity Checking
The fundamental use case involves checking whether an argument (a path-complete set of atomic arguments) is valid according to specified logical systems:
- Parse the strings in premises and conclusions
- Apply user-defined validity rules
- Support multiple definitions of validity
- Provide detailed validation reports

#### Custom Logic Systems
- Define domain-specific inference rules
- Implement specialized validity criteria
- Support non-classical logics
- Enable experimental reasoning systems

## Script Capabilities

### String Parsing
Scripts can parse the textual content of premises and conclusions to:
- Extract logical structure
- Identify key terms and relationships
- Transform natural language to formal representations
- Recognize domain-specific notation

### Tree Analysis
Scripts operate on entire argument trees to:
- Trace logical dependencies
- Identify proof strategies
- Find redundant reasoning paths
- Analyze argument tree structures for optimization opportunities

### Metrics and Statistics
Generate quantitative analyses:
- Proof complexity measures
- Argument strength indicators
- Coverage analysis
- Statistical patterns

## Integration Architecture

### Script Runtime
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Access to argument tree data structures
- Standard API for tree manipulation
- Performance optimization for large proofs

### Data Access
Scripts can:
- Read premise and conclusion strings
- Navigate connection structures
- Access metadata and annotations
- Query cross-document references

### Output Formats
Analysis results can be:
- Visual overlays on the proof
- Separate analysis reports
- Exported data files
- Real-time feedback

## Domain Applications

### Mathematical Logic
- Formal proof verification
- Theorem prover integration
- Symbolic manipulation
- Automated proof search

### Legal Reasoning
- Precedent analysis
- Argument strength evaluation
- Counter-argument detection
- Case law pattern matching

### Scientific Method
- Hypothesis testing frameworks
- Evidence evaluation
- Experimental design validation
- Statistical inference checking

### Educational Assessment
- Student proof evaluation
- Common error detection
- Progress tracking
- Personalized feedback generation

## Sharing and Collaboration

### Script Libraries
- Community repositories
- Peer review mechanisms
- Version control integration
- Documentation standards

### Collaborative Development
- Team script development
- Fork and modify workflows
- Pull request processes
- Testing frameworks

## Security and Safety

### Sandboxing
- Isolated execution environments
- Resource limits
- Access control
- Audit logging

### Validation
- Script verification before execution
- Type checking
- Static analysis
- Runtime monitoring

## Future Extensibility

The analysis framework is designed to grow with user needs:
- Plugin architecture for new capabilities
- Integration with external tools
- Machine learning applications
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Philosophy

Analysis transforms static proofs into dynamic objects of study. By enabling custom processing, the platform becomes a laboratory for logical experimentation rather than merely a proof editor.
