# Visual Proof Construction: Statement Flow Visualization

*Note: This document describes one approach to visual proof construction - a 2D spatial interface with direct manipulation of statement flow networks. The platform's architecture supports many different visualization approaches across different devices and platforms, and this represents just one possibility among many.*

## Visual Representation Method

This approach represents logical structures as **physical statement flow systems** through spatial arrangement and flow visualization. Proof construction occurs through direct manipulation of statement pathways where statements physically move between nodes. The visualization shows how statements flow through the system like data through nodes in a network, adapting to platform capabilities - desktop environments with precise flow control and mobile environments with touch-based statement routing.

## Core Visual Elements

### Spatial Representation [CORE]
- **Document Workspace**: Infinite 2D canvas where physical statement flow systems are positioned [CORE]
- **Flow System Positioning**: Each flow system has x,y coordinates in the workspace [CORE]
- **Node Layout**: Within each system, nodes are arranged to show statement flow patterns between them [CORE]
- **Independent Movement**: Entire flow systems can be dragged to new positions [CORE]
- **Zoom Levels**: From individual statement flows between nodes to entire document overview [CORE]

**Spatial Independence**: Moving a flow system spatially doesn't affect the actual statement pathways between nodes - it's just repositioning the physical visualization for clarity.

### Direct Manipulation [CORE]
- Drag entire statement flow systems to reposition [CORE]
- Connect statement sources to destinations to build flow pathways between nodes [CORE]
- Choose layout styles for each flow system [CORE framework, LSP options]
- Fine-tune flow visualization with position overrides if needed [CORE]

### Progressive Complexity
- Start with simple connections
- Build up complex structures
- Zoom out to see patterns
- Zoom in for details

#### Statement Flow Visualization
- **Statement Trails**: Visual paths showing how statements move from node to node through the system
- **Flow Highlighting**: See which statements flow through your current node selection
- **Flow Exploration**: Understand how statement pathways split and converge between nodes
- **Flow Strength**: Visual indicators showing the volume and complexity of statement movement between nodes

## Visual Language

### The Implication Line (in this visualization) [LSP]
- Shown as a horizontal separator [LSP visual choice]
- Visually distinguishes premises from conclusions [LSP rendering]
- Extends to accommodate content [CORE layout]
- Becomes a recognition anchor [LSP design]

*Note: Other visualizations might use boxes, colors, arrows, or entirely different representations for the implication relation.*

### Flow Visualization
- Lines show statement movement pathways between nodes [CORE detects, LSP renders]
- Direction indicates statement flow direction from node to node [CORE data, LSP visualization]
- Thickness shows statement volume flowing between nodes [LSP visual encoding]
- Color indicates flow status between nodes [LSP visual encoding]

### Spatial Grouping
- Related statement processing nodes cluster naturally
- Visual proximity shows statement flow relationships between nodes
- Whitespace provides clear flow channels between processing nodes
- Layout tells the statement movement story through the node network

## Interaction Paradigms

### Two-Phase Construction Process

#### Phase 1: Define Statement Processing Nodes
1. **Create Statements**: Define reusable text snippets that will flow through the node network
2. **Create Arguments**: Define statement transformation templates (input statements→output statements)
3. **Validate Transformations**: Ensure transformations follow your logical system's rules
4. **Build Library**: Accumulate reusable statement processing node components

#### Phase 2: Build Statement Flow Systems  
1. **Start System**: Create new flow system at chosen workspace position
2. **Add Root Node**: Select a statement transformation as the root processing node
3. **Create Flow Pathways**: Add nodes to supply required input statements to other nodes
4. **Position Spatially**: Arrange system in workspace for clear flow visualization between nodes
5. **Extend Flows**: Create additional pathways by routing outputs from nodes to new processing nodes
6. **Create Multiple Systems**: Build independent flow systems at different positions
7. **Organize Workspace**: Move systems around for optimal flow visualization

## Advanced Visual Features

### Multiple Views
- Tree view for hierarchy
- Connection view for relationships
- Linear view for sequences
- Compact view for overview
- Mini-map for navigation

### Navigation Features [CORE]
- **Zoom Control**: Zoom in or out to adjust detail level [CORE]
- **Cardinal Movement**: Move view in any direction (up, down, left, right) [CORE]
- **Mini-map Navigation**: Select areas to view on the small overview map [CORE]
- **Mini-map**: Shows spatial layout of all argument trees and current view position [CORE]

#### Advanced Flow Navigation
- **Flow Origin Tracking**: `flow-source::` queries instantly jump to the ultimate source node of any statement
- **Flow Traversal**: Navigate upstream with `flow-parent::atomic_argument[3]` to see statement source nodes
- **Statement Chains**: Follow how statements move from producer nodes to consumer nodes
- **Multi-step Jumps**: Navigate complex flow pathways between nodes in single operations
- **Smart Pathfinding**: Find the statement flow path between any two processing nodes

**Navigation Examples:**
- Right-click any statement → "Go to Flow Source" shows which node this statement originates from
- Ctrl+Click on premise → "Find All Producers" shows every node that produces this statement
- Shift+Click on atomic argument → "Show Flow Chain" reveals the complete statement pathway between nodes
- Alt+Click → "Navigate to Flow Level N" jumps to specific upstream source nodes

### Document Overview (Distinct from Mini-map)
The document overview provides a high-level understanding of your proof document:

*Note: While the mini-map shows spatial layout and position for navigation, the document overview provides semantic summaries and analysis of your argument trees - it's about understanding content, not location.*

#### Tree Summaries
- **Name**: User-defined names for each argument tree [CORE]
- **Size**: Number of atomic arguments in the tree [CORE]
- **Custom Fields**: Domain-specific analysis data [LSP provides]

#### Tree Selection and Details
When selecting a tree in the overview:
- View centers on the selected tree [CORE]
- Additional details appear:
  - **Open Premises**: Ordered sets not connected as premises elsewhere (potential connection points) [CORE identifies]
  - **Open Conclusions**: Ordered sets not connected as conclusions elsewhere (available for further reasoning) [CORE identifies]
  - **Custom Analysis**: User-defined analysis results [LSP provides]

#### Advanced Flow Analysis
- **Flow Depth**: Shows maximum `flow-parent::*` chain length for each system
- **Flow Opportunities**: Uses `statement-consumer::*` queries to find potential links between systems  
- **Flow Completeness**: Identifies `flow-source::*` vs open statement requirements for each system
- **Flow Complexity**: Analyzes branching patterns and statement routing density between nodes

#### Big Picture Understanding
- See all statement flow systems at a glance
- Understand document structure without spatial navigation
- Quick access to any system by name
- Track flow complexity and routing opportunities between nodes

## Design Principles for This Visualization Approach

### Clarity First
Every visual element serves comprehension. If it doesn't help understanding, it doesn't belong.

### Consistent Metaphors
Visual language remains consistent across contexts within this visualization system. Users learn once, apply everywhere.

### Responsive Design
Visualizations adapt to available space while maintaining logical relationships.

### Performance Matters
Smooth interaction at all scales, from simple proofs to complex theorems.

### Not the Only Way
This 2D spatial approach is one of many possible visualizations. Other approaches might use:
- 3D or VR representations
- Node-link diagrams with different layouts
- Textual representations with visual augmentation
- Animation-based temporal representations
- Domain-specific specialized visualizations
