# Visual Proof Construction

*Note: This document describes one approach to visual proof construction - a 2D spatial interface with direct manipulation. The platform's architecture supports many different visualization approaches across different devices and platforms, and this represents just one possibility among many.*

## Visual Representation Method

This approach represents logical structures through spatial arrangement and graphical elements. Proof construction occurs through direct manipulation of visual components rather than text-based syntax entry. The visualization adapts to platform capabilities - desktop environments with precise mouse control and mobile environments with touch-first interaction patterns.

## Core Visual Elements

### Spatial Representation [CORE]
- In this visualization, argument trees are positioned in 2D space [CORE]
- Individual atomic arguments get their positions computed from tree structure [CORE]
- Relationships shown through tree layout [CORE layout engine]
- Logical flow follows visual hierarchy [LSP can customize]
- Structure is computed from connections [CORE]

### Direct Manipulation [CORE]
- Drag entire trees to reposition [CORE]
- Connect atomic arguments to build trees [CORE]
- Choose layout styles for each tree [CORE framework, LSP options]
- Fine-tune with position overrides if needed [CORE]

### Progressive Complexity
- Start with simple connections
- Build up complex structures
- Zoom out to see patterns
- Zoom in for details

#### Logical Flow Visualization
- **Ancestor Trails**: Visual paths showing how conclusions trace back to roots
- **Dependency Highlighting**: See which arguments depend on your current selection
- **Branch Exploration**: Understand how logical reasoning splits and converges
- **Connection Strength**: Visual indicators showing the complexity of logical relationships

## Visual Language

### The Implication Line (in this visualization) [LSP]
- Shown as a horizontal separator [LSP visual choice]
- Visually distinguishes premises from conclusions [LSP rendering]
- Extends to accommodate content [CORE layout]
- Becomes a recognition anchor [LSP design]

*Note: Other visualizations might use boxes, colors, arrows, or entirely different representations for the implication relation.*

### Connection Visualization
- Lines show logical dependencies [CORE detects, LSP renders]
- Direction indicates flow [CORE data, LSP visualization]
- Thickness shows importance [LSP visual encoding]
- Color indicates status [LSP visual encoding]

### Spatial Grouping
- Related atomic arguments cluster naturally
- Visual proximity implies logical connection
- Whitespace provides breathing room
- Layout tells the story

## Interaction Paradigms

### Construction Flow (Platform-Agnostic)
1. **Create**: Begin with a new atomic argument (shown here as an implication line)
2. **Add Content**: Type or enter characters into areas above and/or below the line
3. **Add Side Text**: Enter text into fields on either side of the line
4. **Branch**: Create new atomic arguments branching from selected atomic arguments or as unconnected atomic arguments
5. **Connect**: Branch from atomic arguments to share ordered sets
6. **Arrange**: Position for clarity
7. **Refine**: Iterate on structure

### Platform-Specific Interactions

#### Desktop/VS Code Interactions
- **Mouse operations**: Precise cursor positioning and selection
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Rapid command execution

- **Touch feedback**: Haptic response for successful interactions
- **Touch menus**: Large, thumb-friendly context menus
- **Drag gestures**: Touch-and-hold for repositioning elements
- **Voice input**: Speech-to-text for logical statement entry

### Visual Feedback (Platform-Adapted)

#### Desktop Feedback
- **Hover previews**: Rich connection information on mouse hover
- **Cursor changes**: Visual indication of available actions

## Benefits Over Text

### Cognitive Advantages

- Pattern recognition kicks in
- Spatial memory helps recall
- Less cognitive load

### Learning Benefits
- Mistakes are visible
- Structure teaches itself
- Progress is apparent
- Success feels tangible

### Communication Power
- Show others your reasoning
- Present complex ideas simply
- Collaborate visually
- Teach through demonstration

## Advanced Visual Features

### Multiple Views
- Tree view for hierarchy
- Graph view for connections
- Linear view for sequences
- Compact view for overview
- Mini-map for navigation

### Navigation Features [CORE]
- **Zoom Control**: Zoom in or out to adjust detail level [CORE]
- **Cardinal Movement**: Move view in any direction (up, down, left, right) [CORE]
- **Mini-map Navigation**: Select areas to view on the small overview map [CORE]
- **Mini-map**: Shows spatial layout of all argument trees and current view position [CORE]

#### Advanced Tree Navigation
- **Proof Origin Tracking**: `proof-root::` queries instantly jump to the ultimate source of any logical chain
- **Ancestor Traversal**: Navigate to "parent of parent's parent" with `ancestor::atomic_argument[3]`
- **Dependency Chains**: Follow how conclusions become premises in other arguments
- **Multi-step Jumps**: Navigate complex logical relationships in single operations
- **Smart Pathfinding**: Find the logical path between any two arguments

**Navigation Examples:**
- Right-click any conclusion → "Go to Proof Root" shows the ultimate source
- Ctrl+Click on premise → "Find All Users" shows every argument that uses this conclusion
- Shift+Click on atomic argument → "Show Ancestry" reveals the complete logical chain
- Alt+Click → "Navigate to Level N" jumps to specific ancestor depths

### Document Overview (Distinct from Mini-map)
The document overview provides a high-level understanding of your proof document:

*Note: While the mini-map shows spatial layout and position for navigation, the document overview provides semantic summaries and analysis of your argument trees - it's about understanding content, not location.*

#### Tree Summaries
- **Name**: User-defined names for each argument tree [CORE]
- **Size**: Number of atomic arguments in the tree [CORE]
- **Custom Fields**: Domain-specific analysis data [LSP provides]

#### Tree Selection and Details
When selecting a tree in the overview:
- View centers on the selected tree [CORE]
- Additional details appear:
  - **Open Premises**: Ordered sets not connected as premises elsewhere (potential connection points) [CORE identifies]
  - **Open Conclusions**: Ordered sets not connected as conclusions elsewhere (available for further reasoning) [CORE identifies]
  - **Custom Analysis**: User-defined analysis results [LSP provides]

#### Advanced Tree Analysis
- **Dependency Depth**: Shows maximum `ancestor::*` chain length for each tree
- **Connection Opportunities**: Uses `conclusion-child::*` queries to find potential links between trees  
- **Proof Completeness**: Identifies `proof-root::*` vs open premises for each tree
- **Complexity Metrics**: Analyzes branching patterns and logical density

#### Big Picture Understanding
- See all argument trees at a glance
- Understand document structure without spatial navigation
- Quick access to any tree by name
- Track proof complexity and connection opportunities

## Design Principles for This Visualization Approach

### Clarity First
Every visual element serves comprehension. If it doesn't help understanding, it doesn't belong.

### Consistent Metaphors
Visual language remains consistent across contexts within this visualization system. Users learn once, apply everywhere.

### Responsive Design
Visualizations adapt to available space while maintaining logical relationships.

### Performance Matters
Smooth interaction at all scales, from simple proofs to complex theorems.

### Not the Only Way
This 2D spatial approach is one of many possible visualizations. Other approaches might use:
- 3D or VR representations
- Node-link diagrams with different layouts
- Textual representations with visual augmentation
- Animation-based temporal representations
- Domain-specific specialized visualizations
