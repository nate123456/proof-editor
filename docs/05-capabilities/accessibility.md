# Accessibility

## The AI-Augmented Paradigm

**IMPORTANT**: This document describes traditional accessibility infrastructure. For the complete accessibility vision, see [AI-Augmented Accessibility](ai-augmented-accessibility.md), which redefines accessibility through human-AI collaboration.

**Traditional accessibility** focuses on accommodating different user capabilities. **AI-augmented accessibility** eliminates barriers by enabling domain experts to collaborate with AI rather than learning technical skills.

## Logic for Everyone, Everywhere

Accessibility in Proof Editor leverages platform-native accessibility infrastructure while adding proof-specific accommodations. By building on each platform's foundation (VS Code on desktop, React Native on mobile), we inherit extensive accessibility features and focus our efforts on making proof construction accessible.

### Our Approach: Abstract + Enhance + AI-Augment
- **Abstract platform capabilities**: Use platform-appropriate accessibility APIs

## The Paradigm Shift: Traditional → AI-Augmented

### Traditional Accessibility Thinking
- Design for "programmers" vs "non-programmers"
- Accommodate different technical skill levels
- Provide alternative interfaces for the same functionality
- Focus on reducing barriers to using existing features

### AI-Augmented Accessibility Reality
- Domain experts collaborate with AI to implement their ideas
- Philosophy professors describe logic systems → AI generates implementations
- Students get AI assistance with errors and explanations
- Technical skills become irrelevant; domain expertise becomes paramount

**See [AI-Augmented Accessibility](ai-augmented-accessibility.md) for the complete vision and implementation strategy.**

## Core Principles

### Traditional Principle
Accessibility isn't a feature - it's fundamental to democratizing formal logic. Every barrier we remove opens logic to more minds.

### AI-Augmented Principle  
Accessibility means eliminating the gap between conceptual understanding and technical implementation. AI collaboration transforms domain experts into implementers, making logic tools accessible through expertise amplification rather than skill accommodation.

**The future of accessibility is not teaching everyone to code - it's making coding unnecessary for domain experts through AI partnership.**
