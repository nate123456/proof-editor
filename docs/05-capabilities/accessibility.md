# Accessibility

## Logic for Everyone, Everywhere

Accessibility in Proof Editor leverages VS Code's mature accessibility infrastructure while adding proof-specific accommodations. By building on VS Code's foundation, we inherit extensive accessibility features and focus our efforts on making proof construction accessible.

### Our Approach: Inherit + Enhance
- **Inherit from VS Code**: Leverage existing accessibility infrastructure
