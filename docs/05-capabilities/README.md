# Capabilities

## What Users Can Do

This section details the core capabilities that Proof Editor provides to users. Each capability is designed to address specific pain points while enabling new ways of working with formal logic.

## In This Section

### [Visual Proof Construction](visual-proof.md)
Building proofs through direct manipulation and visual representation.

### [IDE Features](ide-features.md)
Modern development environment capabilities adapted for logic.

### [Accessibility](accessibility.md)
Working across platforms and supporting all users.

### [Validation](validation.md)
Real-time checking and intelligent feedback.

### [Analysis](analysis.md)
Custom script processing for argument trees.

### [Presentation](presentation.md)
Publishing and presenting argument trees clearly.

## Design Philosophy

These capabilities work together to create a cohesive experience. Visual construction makes logic approachable, IDE features make it powerful, accessibility makes it widely usable, and validation makes it reliable.

## Integration

Each capability reinforces the others:
- Visual proofs benefit from IDE intelligence
- IDE features work across all platforms
- Validation provides immediate visual feedback
- Accessibility ensures everyone can use every feature
