# IDE Features for Logic

## Bringing Modern Development Tools to Formal Reasoning

Proof Editor provides powerful IDE capabilities across platforms (VS Code desktop and React Native mobile) with proof-specific intelligence. By building on proven platform capabilities and extending them with logical reasoning assistance, we deliver familiar development tools enhanced for formal reasoning.

### Our Approach: Abstract + Extend
- **Abstract platform capabilities**: Use platform-appropriate implementations (VS Code APIs, React Native components)
- **Extend with LSP**: Add proof-specific intelligence through Language Server Protocol
- **Own proof features**: Focus development on proof construction, visualization, and analysis
- **Cross-platform core**: 90%+ of functionality works identically across platforms

## Intelligence Features

- **Completion requests**: LSP provides context-aware suggestions
  ```typescript
  // Custom LSP request for proof completion
  interface ProofCompletionRequest {
    atomicArgumentId: string;
    position: 'premise' | 'conclusion';
    cursorPosition: number;
    proofContext: ProofState;
  }
  ```

### Find and Navigate [CORE + LSP]
- **Find usages**: Where is this ordered set used? [CORE navigation, LSP semantic analysis]
  - Platform tracks ordered set references across document
  - LSP provides semantic understanding of usage contexts
  - Visual highlighting of all usage locations
- **Go to definition**: Jump to first occurrence [CORE navigation]

#### Powerful Tree Navigation
- **Ancestor navigation**: `ancestor::atomic_argument[2]` finds the "grandparent" argument

- **Dependency chains**: `premise-parent::*` shows all atomic arguments that use this conclusion
- **Multi-step traversal**: Navigate complex proof paths with single operations
- **Deep drilling**: `//statement[text()='P']/conclusion-child::*` finds all arguments using "P" as a premise

- `Ctrl+Shift+C` shows all children that use this conclusion as premise
- Quick navigation to "great-grandparent" argument with `Ctrl+Shift+3`

- "Find all dead-end conclusions (not used as premises)": `//atomic_argument[not(conclusions/*/conclusion-child::*)]`
- "Show logical chains 5+ steps deep": `//atomic_argument[count(ancestor::*) >= 5]`
- "Find circular reasoning attempts": `//atomic_argument[ancestor::*/conclusions/*/text() = premises/*/text()]`

### Structural Views [VS CODE + CORE]
