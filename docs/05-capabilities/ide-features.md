# IDE Features for Logic

## Bringing Modern Development Tools to Formal Reasoning

Just as IDEs revolutionized programming, Proof Editor brings intelligent assistance, navigation, and refactoring to logical reasoning. These features transform proof construction from manual labor to assisted thinking.

## Intelligence Features

### IntelliSense for Logic
- **Auto-completion**: Suggest logical next steps
- **Rule suggestions**: Show applicable inference rules
- **Template expansion**: Quick insertion of common patterns
- **Context awareness**: Suggestions based on current proof state

### Find and Navigate
- **Find usages**: Where is this statement used?
- **Go to definition**: Jump to first occurrence
- **Find references**: See all connections
- **Symbol navigation**: Quick jumping between elements

### Refactoring Tools
- **Rename everywhere**: Change statement names globally
- **Extract subproof**: Create reusable lemmas
- **Inline expansion**: Replace references with content
- **Reorganize**: Restructure while preserving logic

## Navigation Excellence

### Multi-Level Navigation
- **Document level**: Between proof trees
- **Tree level**: Through argument tree structures  
- **Statement level**: Following connections
- **History**: Back/forward through navigation

### Smart Search
- **Semantic search**: Find by meaning, not just text
- **Pattern search**: Locate proof structures
- **Cross-document**: Search entire libraries
- **Filters**: By type, author, date, status

### Structural Views
- **Outline view**: Hierarchical proof structure
- **Minimap**: Visual overview
- **Breadcrumbs**: Current location path
- **Split views**: Compare proofs side-by-side

## Real-Time Analysis

### Error Detection
- **Logic errors**: Circular reasoning, missing premises
- **Style issues**: Overly complex proofs
- **Best practices**: Suggest improvements
- **Quick fixes**: One-click corrections

### Proof Metrics
- **Complexity analysis**: How complex is this proof?
- **Coverage**: What's proven, what's assumed?
- **Dependencies**: What relies on what?
- **Statistics**: Length, depth, connections

## Productivity Accelerators

### Snippets and Templates
- **Proof patterns**: Common atomic argument structures
- **Domain templates**: Field-specific formats
- **Custom snippets**: Personal shortcuts
- **Smart insertion**: Context-aware placement

### Multi-Cursor Editing
- **Batch changes**: Edit multiple places at once
- **Pattern selection**: Select all similar
- **Synchronized editing**: Keep consistency
- **Column operations**: Vertical editing

### Keyboard Mastery
- **Command palette**: All commands searchable
- **Customizable shortcuts**: Personal preferences
- **Vim/Emacs modes**: For power users
- **Chording**: Complex operations simply

## Collaboration Features

### Live Sharing
- **Real-time collaboration**: Work together
- **Cursor tracking**: See where others are
- **Shared debugging**: Solve problems together
- **Voice/video integration**: Discuss while working

### Version Intelligence
- **Smart diff**: Understand proof changes
- **Blame annotations**: Who added what when
- **Branch visualization**: See proof evolution
- **Merge assistance**: Combine proof versions

## Extensibility
