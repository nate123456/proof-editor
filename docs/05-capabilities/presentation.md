## Publishing and Presenting Argument Trees

The presentation capability addresses the need to share and present argument trees in clean, focused views. Similar to how presentation software separates editing from presenting, Proof Editor provides specialized modes for sharing logical reasoning with audiences.

## Presentation View

### Clean Interface
The presentation view removes all editing tools and interface elements to provide:
- Uncluttered display of argument tree structures
- Focus on logical flow without distractions
- Professional appearance for formal settings
- Optimized readability

### Navigation Controls
Presentation mode includes specialized navigation:
- Step-through individual atomic arguments
- Zoom to specific proof sections
- Highlight active reasoning paths
- Smooth transitions between views

## Publishing Options

### Static Export
Generate shareable versions of documents:
- PDF with preserved visual layout
- HTML for web embedding
- Image formats for inclusion in papers
- Vector graphics for high-quality printing

### Interactive Publishing
Share dynamic, explorable proofs:
- Web-based viewers
- Embedded interactive widgets
- Shareable links with view states
- Version-controlled publications

## Design Principles

### Clarity Above All
Every element in presentation mode serves to clarify the logical argument. Visual noise is eliminated while semantic richness is preserved.

### Flexible Delivery
Support diverse presentation contexts from formal lectures to informal discussions, from static documents to dynamic explorations.

### Audience First
Prioritize the viewer's understanding over the author's complexity. Make sophisticated reasoning accessible through thoughtful presentation.

## Technical Implementation

## Philosophy

Presentation transforms private reasoning into public discourse. By separating creation from presentation, we enable clear communication of complex logical structures while maintaining their inherent sophistication.
