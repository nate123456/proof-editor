# Validation

## Real-Time Proof Checking and Intelligent Feedback

Validation in Proof Editor goes beyond simple correctness checking. It provides intelligent, educational feedback that helps users understand their reasoning and improve their proofs.

## Real-Time Validation

### Continuous Checking
- **As-you-type validation**: Instant feedback
- **Visual indicators**: See status immediately
- **Non-blocking**: Work continues during checks
- **Incremental**: Only recheck what changed

### Multi-Level Validation
- **Syntax level**: Well-formed statements
- **Structure level**: Valid connections
- **Logic level**: Sound reasoning
- **Style level**: Best practices

### Responsive Experience
- **Immediate feedback**: Users see results as they work
- **Non-blocking**: Interface remains responsive during validation
- **Smart updates**: Only recheck what changed
- **Handles complexity**: Works smoothly regardless of proof size

## Intelligent Feedback

### Error Messages That Teach
- **What went wrong**: Clear problem description
- **Why it matters**: Explain the issue
- **How to fix**: Actionable suggestions
- **Learn more**: Links to concepts

### Contextual Suggestions

## Philosophy

### Validation as Teaching
Every error is a learning opportunity. Validation doesn't just say "no" - it shows the path to "yes."

### Encouraging Exploration
Users should feel safe to experiment. Validation guides rather than punishes.

### Building Confidence
Clear feedback builds understanding. Users learn to self-validate through experience.

### Continuous Improvement
The system learns from common errors to provide better assistance over time.
