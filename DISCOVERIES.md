# Strategic Development Discoveries

*Natural discoveries that emerge from development work, requiring human judgment or design decisions.*

## [2025-01-04 22:18:00] - Starting /iterate Quality Gates

**Goal**: Comprehensive testing and quality iteration with 95% coverage target.

**Quality Gates Sequence**:
1. **Prettier formatting** (first - always)
2. **TypeScript compilation** (before ESLint - enables type-aware rules)
3. **ESLint compliance** (after TypeScript passes)
4. **Test failures** (fix broken tests)
5. **Coverage gaps** (reach 95% coverage)
6. **Integration testing** (cross-layer verification)

**Parallel Agent Strategy**: 5+ agents per gate when issues found, working on isolated subsets.
