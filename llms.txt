## Core Concepts

**Atomic Arguments**: Single inference steps represented as relations between premise and conclusion n-tuples.

**Argument Trees**: Connected collections of atomic arguments forming complete proof structures.

**Extensible Logic Systems**: User-definable logical frameworks with custom symbols, rules, and validation.

## Project Status

Currently in conceptual design phase - defining problem space, user requirements, and system capabilities.
