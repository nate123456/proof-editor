# Proof Editor

A platform for constructing and analyzing formal logical arguments using visual representations and integrated development environment capabilities.

## Project Overview

Proof Editor combines visual representation of logical structures with development environment features adapted from software engineering tools. The platform supports user-defined logical systems and provides mechanisms for sharing and extending these systems.

## Core Concepts

### Atomic Arguments
An atomic argument represents a single inference step as a relation between two ordered n-tuples of strings:
- Premises: n-tuple above the implication line
- Conclusions: n-tuple below the implication line
- Implication line: horizontal separator with optional side labels
- Each atomic argument represents exactly one logical inference

### Argument Trees
Collections of atomic arguments connected through shared statements:
- Arguments connect when a conclusion from one serves as a premise in another
- Trees contain all transitively connected arguments
- Each tree represents a complete proof or reasoning structure

### Extensible Logic Systems
The platform supports user-defined logical systems through:
- Custom symbol definitions and inference rules
- Modular system composition
- Package-based distribution
- Version-controlled definitions

## Platform Capabilities

### Visual Construction
- Spatial arrangement of logical elements
- Direct manipulation of proof structures

## Project Phase

The project is currently in the conceptual design phase, focusing on:
- Problem space analysis
- User requirements gathering
- Core concept definition
- Technical feasibility assessment

## Documentation Structure

Detailed documentation is organized in `/docs`:
