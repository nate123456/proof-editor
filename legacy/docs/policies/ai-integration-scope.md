# AI Integration Scope and Boundaries

## Core Principle: AI as Optional External Tool, Outside Explicit Support

Proof Editor is designed with **semantic neutrality** at its core. AI assistance, where users choose to employ it, operates **completely outside** our explicit support scope. The platform provides documentation and examples that enable users to leverage AI tools if they wish, but this is beyond our direct implementation.

## Clear Scope Boundaries

### ✅ **IN SCOPE: Documentation for AI Usage Patterns**

#### Documentation Examples
- **Language Package Development**: Documentation showing how users might use AI tools to help describe logical rules and generate YAML configs
- **Rule Writing Patterns**: Examples of how AI tools could assist with inference rule implementation
- **Usage Guides**: Documentation on common patterns users employ when working with external AI tools
- **Best Practices**: Community-contributed examples of effective AI collaboration patterns

#### Optional External Integration Points
- **Extension Architecture**: Platform designed to allow external AI tools to integrate if users choose
- **Documentation Coverage**: Document how users might leverage AI through external services
- **Community Examples**: Share patterns the community discovers for AI-assisted development

### ❌ **OUT OF SCOPE: Explicit AI Support or Implementation**

#### No AI in Core Platform
- **No AI tracking in statements**: Statement entities and ordered sets contain NO AI-related functionality
- **No AI features in core**: The platform doesn't implement AI capabilities
- **No AI metadata**: Core business logic remains completely AI-agnostic
- **No AI dependencies**: All functionality works completely independently of AI

#### No AI Integration or Support
- **No AI in platform logic**: All platform capabilities are AI-independent
- **No AI implementation**: We don't build or maintain AI features
- **No AI-specific APIs**: Platform doesn't provide AI-related interfaces
- **No AI support**: Users employ AI tools entirely on their own

#### No AI Maintenance or Development
- **No AI development**: We don't develop AI capabilities
- **No AI debugging**: AI-related issues are outside our support scope
- **No AI documentation maintenance**: Users document their own AI usage patterns
- **No AI feature requests**: AI functionality is not part of our roadmap

## Documented AI Usage Patterns (All External)

### Language Package Development
**Documented Pattern**: 
- User describes logical concept to external AI tool
- AI tool generates YAML config and JavaScript rules
- User reviews, modifies, and implements the package
- Resulting package works normally with the platform

**Platform Role**: None - users employ whatever AI tools they prefer

### Proof Construction Assistance  
**Documented Pattern**:
- User constructs proof using platform interface
- User consults external AI for suggestions or error analysis
- User implements suggestions through normal platform editing
- Final proof is standard platform output

**Platform Role**: None - AI consultation happens outside the platform

### Educational Support
**Documented Pattern**:
- Student encounters validation error in platform
- Student asks external AI to explain the error
- Student learns from AI explanation and corrects proof in platform
- Learning happens through external AI, platform provides validation

**Platform Role**: Standard validation only - AI explanation is external

## Data Model Simplification

### What We Don't Track
- ❌ Whether content was AI-generated
- ❌ Which AI model was used
- ❌ AI confidence scores
- ❌ Human validation of AI content
- ❌ AI interaction logs in proof files
- ❌ AI analysis of statement patterns or ordered set relationships
- ❌ AI manipulation of physical tree structures or spatial positioning

### What We Do Track (Minimally)
- ✅ Human authorship (standard collaboration feature)
- ✅ Source language package (for rule attribution)
- ✅ Basic timestamps (standard metadata)
- ✅ External references (academic citations)
- ✅ Statement entities and ordered set relationships (core platform functionality)
- ✅ Physical tree positioning and spatial layout data

## Benefits of This Approach

### Focus
- Core system remains entirely focused on statement processing and physical tree manipulation
- No distraction from AI feature development or maintenance
- Clear scope boundaries for our development team focused on spatial reasoning and ordered set operations

### Reliability
- Core statement processing functionality never depends on external services
- No AI-related failures can affect physical tree operations or ordered set relationships
- Consistent platform behavior for spatial reasoning regardless of user's AI choices

### Privacy
- No AI interactions tracked or stored in platform
- Users maintain complete control over AI usage
- Platform files contain only statement entities, ordered set relationships, and physical tree positioning data

### User Freedom
- Users choose their own AI tools and strategies
- No lock-in to specific AI providers or approaches
- Platform evolution independent of AI technology changes

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Core Platform Developers
- Never add AI-related fields, APIs, or features
- Platform functionality must be completely AI-independent
- Don't create integration points for AI services
- Focus entirely on statement processing, ordered set operations, and physical tree manipulation capabilities

### For Documentation Contributors
- Document AI usage patterns as community examples
- Show how external AI tools can assist users
- Provide templates and examples for AI-assisted workflows
- Keep AI documentation separate from core platform docs

### For Extension Developers
- External AI integration is entirely up to extension authors
- Extensions should work without AI dependencies
- AI features in extensions are unsupported by core team
- Document AI usage patterns for community benefit

## Future Considerations

### Maintaining Clear Boundaries
- Resist all pressure to add AI features to platform
- Keep AI usage entirely external to our scope
- Maintain semantic neutrality and focus
- Review new features to prevent AI scope creep

### Evolution Path
- Community can develop AI usage patterns for statement processing independently
- Users can employ whatever AI tools work best for them with tree structures and ordered sets
- Platform evolution stays focused on physical tree manipulation, spatial reasoning, and statement entity operations
- System remains useful for statement processing regardless of AI technology changes

This scope ensures Proof Editor remains a focused, reliable tool for statement processing and physical tree reasoning that users can enhance with their choice of external AI tools, rather than a platform that attempts to provide AI capabilities.
