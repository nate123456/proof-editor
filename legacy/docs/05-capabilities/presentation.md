# Presentation

## Publishing and Presenting Argument Trees

The presentation capability leverages platform-native infrastructure while providing proof-specific presentation features. By building on each platform's strengths, we create clean, focused views for sharing logical reasoning with audiences.

### Our Approach: Abstract + Specialize
- **Abstract platform capabilities**: Use platform-appropriate rendering and export systems
- **Specialize for proofs**: Custom presentation modes and proof-specific annotations
- **Integrate seamlessly**: Presentation tools feel native to each platform

## Presentation View

### Clean Interface [CORE]
The presentation view removes all editing tools and interface elements to provide:
- **Uncluttered display**: Platform removes editing UI elements [CORE]
- **Focus on logical flow**: Platform provides distraction-free rendering [CORE]
- **Professional appearance**: Platform applies presentation-specific styling [CORE]
- **Optimized readability**: Platform adjusts typography and spacing [CORE]
- **PowerPoint-like distinction**: Platform provides distinct presentation mode [CORE]

### Navigation Controls [CORE]
Presentation mode includes specialized navigation:
- **Step-through arguments**: Platform provides sequential navigation [CORE]
- **Zoom to sections**: Platform handles viewport management [CORE]
- **Highlight reasoning paths**: Platform renders path highlighting [CORE]
- **Smooth transitions**: Platform provides animation system [CORE]
- **Mini-map visibility**: Platform maintains spatial overview [CORE]
- **Document overview**: Platform provides tree navigation (see [Visual Proof - Document Overview](./visual-proof.md#document-overview-distinct-from-mini-map)) [CORE]

### Annotation Tools [CORE]
Presentation mode provides temporary annotation overlays that don't modify the proof:
- **Highlight Tool**: Color-highlight sections of the proof to draw attention [CORE]
  - Platform provides highlighting overlay system
  - Real-time highlighting during presentation
  - Customizable highlight colors and styles
- **Drawing Tools**: Platform provides drawing overlay system [CORE]
  - **Lines**: For connecting concepts and showing relationships
  - **Arrows**: For showing flow or emphasis direction
  - **Squiggles**: For informal annotations and emphasis
- **Temporary Nature**: All annotations are overlays that disappear when exiting presentation mode [CORE]
- **Non-destructive**: The underlying proof structure remains unchanged [CORE]

## Design Principles

### Clarity Above All
Every element in presentation mode serves to clarify the logical argument. Visual noise is eliminated while semantic richness is preserved.

### Flexible Delivery
Support diverse presentation contexts from formal lectures to informal discussions, from static documents to dynamic explorations.

### Audience First
Prioritize the viewer's understanding over the author's complexity. Make sophisticated reasoning accessible through thoughtful presentation.

## Philosophy

Presentation transforms private reasoning into public discourse. By separating creation from presentation, we enable clear communication of complex logical structures while maintaining their inherent sophistication.

### Platform-LSP Collaboration in Presentation
The presentation capability demonstrates the power of platform-LSP collaboration:
- **Platform provides**: Rendering, navigation, annotation tools, collaboration infrastructure
- **LSP provides**: Content intelligence, domain-specific formatting, pedagogical guidance
- **Together they enable**: Sophisticated presentation capabilities that adapt to both technical and audience needs

### Content vs. Presentation Intelligence
- **Content intelligence [LSP]**: Understanding what to emphasize, how to simplify, what constitutes logical flow
- **Presentation intelligence [CORE]**: How to render, animate, navigate, and collaborate
- **Seamless integration**: Users experience unified presentation capabilities without seeing the underlying architecture
