# Accessibility

## The Documentation-Driven Paradigm

**IMPORTANT**: This document describes comprehensive accessibility infrastructure that empowers domain experts through clear documentation and examples rather than requiring technical skills.

**Traditional accessibility** focuses on accommodating different user capabilities. **Documentation-driven accessibility** eliminates barriers by enabling domain experts to use comprehensive templates and examples rather than learning technical skills.

## Logic for Everyone, Everywhere

Accessibility in Proof Editor leverages platform-native accessibility infrastructure while adding proof-specific accommodations. By building on each platform's foundation (VS Code on desktop, React Native on mobile), we inherit extensive accessibility features and focus our efforts on making proof construction accessible.

### Our Approach: Abstract + Enhance + Document

## The Paradigm Shift: Traditional → Documentation-Driven

### Traditional Accessibility Thinking
- Design for "programmers" vs "non-programmers"
- Accommodate different technical skill levels
- Provide alternative interfaces for the same functionality
- Focus on reducing barriers to using existing features

### Documentation-Driven Accessibility Reality
- Domain experts use comprehensive documentation to implement their ideas
- Philosophy professors describe logic systems → Templates and examples guide implementation
- Students get clear documentation and validation feedback for errors and explanations
- Technical skills become less relevant; domain expertise becomes paramount through excellent documentation

**See documentation throughout the ecosystem for comprehensive implementation guidance.**

## Core Principles

### Traditional Principle
Accessibility isn't a feature - it's fundamental to democratizing formal logic. Every barrier we remove opens logic to more minds.

### Documentation-Driven Principle  
Accessibility means eliminating the gap between conceptual understanding and technical implementation. Comprehensive documentation and templates transform domain experts into implementers, making logic tools accessible through expertise amplification rather than skill accommodation.

**The future of accessibility is not teaching everyone to code - it's making coding unnecessary for domain experts through excellent documentation and community templates.**
