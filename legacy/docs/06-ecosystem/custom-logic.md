# Custom Logic Systems

## Three-Tier Logic System Creation

Proof Editor enables custom logical systems through a three-tier approach:
- **Tier 1 (90% of users)**: Pure YAML configuration for standard logical patterns
- **Tier 2**: JavaScript programming for custom validation rules
- **Tier 3**: Full LSP development for complete reasoning environments

Most domain experts achieve their goals through Tier 1 configuration, with programming required only for advanced customization.

## Why Configuration-Based Custom Logic?

### Tiered Logic Creation
The three-tier approach accommodates different technical comfort levels:
- **Philosophy professors**: Start with Tier 1 YAML templates, progress to Tier 2 JavaScript for complex modal operators
- **Legal scholars**: Use Tier 1 for standard legal reasoning, Tier 2 for custom precedent weighting algorithms
- **Medical researchers**: Configure Tier 1 for basic diagnostic patterns, Tier 2 for probabilistic uncertainty calculations
- **Business analysts**: Apply Tier 1 for decision trees, Tier 2 for complex risk assessment functions

### Rapid Innovation Across Tiers
- **Tier 1**: Configure concepts → Platform implements through YAML templates
- **Tier 2**: Program validation → Custom JavaScript rules for domain-specific logic
- **Tier 3**: Develop environments → Full LSP programming for complete reasoning systems
- **All Tiers**: Test, iterate, and share through the same distribution system

## Core Concepts

### Logic Definition
Users specify:
- **Symbols**: Custom operators and notation
- **Rules**: Inference patterns and validity
- **Syntax**: How statements are formed
- **Semantics**: What statements mean

### Declarative Approach
Define logic through configuration, not code:
- Human-readable formats
- Visual rule builders
- Template systems
- Import/export capabilities

### Extensibility
Build on existing systems:
- Extend classical logic
- Combine multiple systems
- Override specific rules
- Add domain features

### Security and User Consent
**Important**: Any custom logic systems that include JavaScript validation rules or executable code are subject to the platform's security consent requirements. When sharing such packages with others or installing packages containing executable code, users will be prompted to:
- Review the executable components
- Understand security constraints and sandboxing measures
- Provide explicit consent before installation

For comprehensive details on consent processes and security requirements, see [Language Package Security Policy](../policies/language-package-security-policy.md).

## Three-Tier System Creation

### Three-Tier Documentation Workflows

#### The Philosophy Professor (Tier 1 → Tier 2)
```
Professor: "I need a deontic logic system that distinguishes between 
prima facie obligations and actual obligations."

Tier 1 Implementation: Following the modal logic template, create YAML config:
- O_pf(p) for prima facie obligations  
- O_act(p) for actual obligations
- Standard conflict resolution from templates

Professor: "The standard conflict resolution isn't nuanced enough. 
I need custom weighting based on moral theory."

Tier 2 Implementation: "Now I need to write JavaScript functions for 
custom conflict resolution algorithms based on Ross's moral theory..."
```

#### The Legal Scholar (Tier 1 → Tier 2)
```
Scholar: "Model legal reasoning where statutes create default rules 
that can be overridden by more specific statutes or precedents."

Tier 1 Implementation: "Following the defeasible logic templates:
- Basic defeasible inference rules for statutory defaults
- Standard precedent strength from documented examples

Scholar: "I need custom precedent weighting based on jurisdiction 
hierarchy and case similarity metrics."

Tier 2 Implementation: "This requires JavaScript programming to implement 
the complex precedent analysis algorithms..."
```

### Tier-Appropriate Starting Points
- **Tier 1**: "Like modal logic, but for obligations" → YAML template adaptation
- **Tier 2**: "Take S5 and add custom accessibility relations" → JavaScript programming required
- **Tier 3**: "Complete intuitionistic type theory environment" → Full LSP development
- **All Tiers**: Clear documentation and community examples available

### Definition Components
- **Operators**: AND, OR, IMPLIES, custom
- **Quantifiers**: Universal, existential, custom
- **Inference rules**: Modus ponens, custom patterns
- **Validation rules**: What makes proofs valid

### Progressive Complexity
- Start with simple extensions
- Add features incrementally
- Test with real examples
- Refine based on usage

## Configuration Examples

### Legal Logic System (Template-Based)
**User**: "Create a legal reasoning system for contract law"

**Template Implementation**:
- Custom operators: `Must(x)`, `May(x)`, `Prohibited(x)`
- Precedent relations: `Overrides(case1, case2)`
- Statutory hierarchy: `StatutoryRank(statute, level)`
- Conflict resolution: Template-based rules for competing obligations
- Jurisdiction handling: `AppliesIn(rule, jurisdiction)`

### Medical Diagnostic Logic (Pattern-Based)
**User**: "I need diagnostic reasoning that handles uncertainty and contraindications"

**Documentation-Guided Implementation**:
- Probabilistic operators: `Likely(symptom, disease, p)`
- Diagnostic rules: `IfSymptoms(s1, s2) ThenSuggest(disease, confidence)`
- Contraindication logic: `Contraindicated(treatment, condition)`
- Temporal progression: `LeadsTo(condition1, condition2, timeframe)`

### Business Decision Logic (Framework-Based)
**User**: "Model business decisions with risk assessment and compliance constraints"

**Template-Driven Implementation**:
- Decision operators: `RiskLevel(decision, level)`, `ComplianceCheck(action, regulation)`
- Policy inheritance: `InheritsFrom(subsidiary_policy, parent_policy)`
- Multi-criteria analysis: Framework templates for balancing competing factors

Should you add a consistency constraint, or do you want to model 
genuine moral dilemmas? Check the deontic logic documentation."

User: "Model genuine dilemmas, but flag them for special reasoning"

and special resolution rules in the deontic logic templates..."
