# Collaboration Features

## Working Together: Human-Centered Collaboration

Collaboration in Proof Editor focuses on human-to-human partnerships in creating, refining, and sharing logical systems. Teams work together to build and improve custom logic frameworks for education and research.

## Real-Time Collaboration

### Human-Centered Live Editing
- **Multiple cursors**: See where others work
- **Instant updates**: Changes appear immediately
- **Conflict resolution**: Smart merging with pattern-based assistance
- **Presence awareness**: Know who's active
- **Activity indicators**: See what's changing

### Smart Conflict Resolution
When concurrent edits create logical conflicts, the system provides analysis and resolution support:

**Conflict Analysis**:
- **Statement Flow Disruption**: Identify where edits break statement flow between argument templates
- **Tree Structure Impact**: Show how resolution affects positioning and parent-child relationships
- **Connection Consistency**: Verify Statement identity connections maintain consistency across tree instances
- **Template Instance Conflicts**: Detect when same argument template has conflicting instances
- **Positional Attachment**: Analyze conflicts in premise slot assignments
- **Visual Comparison**: Side-by-side view of conflicting logical structures
- **Collaboration History**: Show how the conflict developed

**Resolution Tools**:
- **Flow-Aware Resolution**: Maintain statement flow when resolving tree structure conflicts
- **Position-Preserving Merge**: Keep parent-child-position relationships intact during merges
- **Template Consistency**: Ensure argument templates remain valid across all instances
- **Interactive Resolution**: Users can review and merge changes
- **Real-Time Validation**: Immediate feedback on resolution choices with flow verification
- **Multiple Options**: Present several viable resolution paths
- **Rollback Support**: Easy undo of problematic changes

### Human Communication

- **Proof annotations**: Explain reasoning
- **Voice/video chat**: Integrated communication
- **Screen sharing**: Demonstrate techniques
- **Persistent discussions**: Threaded conversations

### Coordination

## Asynchronous Collaboration

### Version Control

- **Merge tools**: Combine work

### Review Process
- **Pull requests**: Propose changes
- **Code review tools**: Comment on specifics

- **Automated checks**: Validate changes
- **Discussion threads**: Debate approaches

### Logical Provenance & Attribution
Basic tracking and visualization of authorship and sources for collaborative work.

#### V1 Scope Definition
For the initial release, provenance tracking includes:
- **Original Author ID**: Who first created each atomic argument or ordered set
- **Source Package ID**: Which language package provided rules or axioms  
- **Last Modified By**: Most recent editor of each element
- **Basic Hover Attribution**: Author and creation timestamp on hover

**Deferred to Future Versions**:
- Detailed modification history within elements
- Collaboration session recording and playback
- Advanced citation format generation
- Cross-document provenance tracking
- Complex authorship attribution for merged content

#### V1 Merge Conflict Resolution Process
When concurrent edits create conflicts in the underlying proof files:

**User Experience for Conflicts**:
1. **Conflict Notification**: Users see "Sync conflict detected" notification within 10 seconds
2. **Visual Conflict Interface**: Side-by-side comparison showing:
   - "Your version" (local changes) vs "Their version" (remote changes)
   - Highlighting of specific atomic arguments, statements, and tree nodes in conflict
   - Clear indication of affected statement flow paths and tree structure
   - Position-specific conflicts (which premise slots are affected)
3. **Resolution Options**:
   - **Keep Mine**: Accept local version, discard remote changes
   - **Keep Theirs**: Accept remote version, discard remote changes  
   - **Merge Both**: When non-conflicting, combine both changes while preserving flow
   - **Edit Manually**: Open conflict in editor for custom resolution with flow validation
   - **Reposition Instances**: Adjust tree positioning to resolve attachment conflicts
4. **Validation Feedback**: Immediate validation of chosen resolution with statement flow verification
5. **Confirmation**: Clear indication that conflict is resolved, flow maintained, and sync completed

**Conceptual Scope**: V1 focuses on atomic argument, statement, and tree positioning conflicts. Complex logical validation conflicts are flagged for manual review.

```typescript
interface BasicProvenanceSystem {
  // Query authorship information
  getAuthor(elementId: string): Author;
  
  // Track source packages
  getSourcePackage(elementId: string): LanguagePackage | null;
  
  // Display basic attribution
  displayBasicAttribution(elementId: string): AttributionInfo;
}

interface AttributionInfo {
  elementId: string;
  elementType: 'atomic_argument' | 'statement';
  
  // Basic authorship
  originalAuthor: Author;
  lastModifiedBy: Author;
  
  // Source tracking
  sourcePackage?: LanguagePackage;  // Language package that provided this content
  sourceDocument?: ImportedProof;   // If imported from another proof
}
```

**Basic Authorship Tracking**:
- **Original Creation**: Who first created each atomic argument or statement
