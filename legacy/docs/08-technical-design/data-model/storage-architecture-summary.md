# Storage Architecture Summary

## Storage Foundation Established

Proof Editor uses **WatermelonDB + SQLite** as the multi-platform storage solution, providing the architectural foundation needed for detailed system planning.

## Key Components

### WatermelonDB + SQLite Stack
- **SQLite Database**: ACID transactions, WAL mode, built-in crash recovery
- **WatermelonDB**: Reactive ORM providing multi-platform SQLite abstraction
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access layer abstracting persistence details
- **Platform Adapters**: Native SQLite engines on all platforms

### Platform Support
- **Desktop**: node-sqlite3 binding via WatermelonDB NodeJS adapter
- **Mobile**: React Native built-in SQLite via WatermelonDB RN adapter
- **Cross-Platform**: Identical WatermelonDB API across all platforms

### Storage Benefits
- **ACID Compliance**: Guaranteed data consistency via SQLite transactions
- **Performance**: Optimized indexing and query performance
- **Reactive**: Automatic UI updates when underlying data changes
- **Offline-First**: Full functionality without network dependency
- **Crash Recovery**: Automatic recovery via SQLite WAL mode

## Integration with Core Architecture

### Repository Pattern Implementation
```typescript
interface StorageRepository {
  statements: StatementRepository;
  orderedSets: OrderedSetRepository;
  atomicArguments: AtomicArgumentRepository;
  nodes: NodeRepository;
  trees: TreeRepository;
  documents: DocumentRepository;
  
  transaction<T>(fn: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T>;
}
```

### Connection Model Support
- Ordered set object references persist correctly across app restarts
- Statement building blocks maintain unique IDs in database
- Tree structure and spatial positioning stored separately from logical connections

### Synchronization Foundation
- Operation logging to SQLite for conflict resolution
- Vector clocks and CRDT support via structured storage
- Efficient delta synchronization using SQL queries

## Architecture Planning Ready

With WatermelonDB + SQLite established as the storage foundation:

- **No blocking issues**: Storage approach defined and validated
- **Multi-platform support**: Consistent behavior across all platforms  
- **Performance characteristics**: Known and optimizable
- **Synchronization strategy**: Compatible with CRDT requirements
- **Development ready**: Can proceed with detailed architectural planning

The storage layer provides the necessary persistence foundation for implementing the full Proof Editor architecture.
