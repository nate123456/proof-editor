/**
 * Value Objects Test Suite - Entry Point
 *
 * This file has been split into focused test files following SRP:
 *
 * 1. value-object-base.test.ts - ValueObject base class behavior
 * 2. id-value-objects.test.ts - All ID-based value objects (StatementId, OrderedSetId, etc.)
 * 3. content-value-objects.test.ts - StatementContent and other content-based objects
 * 4. spatial-value-objects.test.ts - Position2D, PhysicalProperties, spatial calculations
 * 5. metadata-value-objects.test.ts - Timestamp, Version, Attachment
 *
 * Each file follows the neverthrow Result pattern and maintains comprehensive test coverage.
 * Run individual focused files for specific value object testing.
 *
 * Priority: CRITICAL (Used throughout entire codebase)
 * Coverage: All value objects are covered in the focused test files above
